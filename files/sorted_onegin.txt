A baker - German, clean and fair,
Abandoned house looks like treasure,
A bashful girl he used to know?
A bear, a big disheveled bear;
A beau of Julia Volmar,
A bee from waxen cell of hive
A beetle buzzed. A brook streamed quiet.
A black monastic on the way
A boat was gliding dozing river
A boring season at threshold;
A bottle made a loud pop,
A bottle of a nice white wine,
About dogs and kin of mine.
About haying, taste of wine,
About maidens, evil beasts;
About olden times of yours...
About Olga he is limning,
About passed and current life,
About private things to tell
About what is dreaming Tanya?
About what they talk this time?
Above a creek was quietly laying
Above their perfect eyebrows is
Above the waters iron bridges
A boy served creamer; there’s no fuss;
A brigadier and fair landlord,
A brook meandering there flows
A cab to stand is pulled by horse,
A case with pistols to prepare
A cause for gossip did provide.
Accept the florid chapters’ row,
Accompanied by French Trike -
Accompanied by portly spouse
Accompanied by sweetheart body.
According to the rules and neatly,
According to the seasons, yearly.
A chasm, which is so dark and sad...
A chemise on the neck has folded
A circle of the future brides -
A clear, sensible idea,
A cloud of a deadly pallor
A coachman sits on a cart’s height.
A common fate could await him,
A company commander comes,
A copybook with touching rhymes
A cordial friend I’d maybe find,
A country maiden I am gazing.
A crawfish sits on spider’s head,
A creek is silvered by a beam,
A cue is resting on a pool,
A cup of tea is on the tray.
A curtain rustles in a whirl.
A dairymaid delivers milk,
A dame is coming, not alone,
A daring thought at once occurred.
A darkened lamp, a desk for chess,
A dashing cart is speeding by;
A dawn gets up in chilly shadow,
A day flew by - no reply letter,
Admired Russian winter, snow
A doleful native so-called poet? -
Adorned by the cold beauty’s features
A dreadful signet of inferno...
A dream now pleasing and now sad.
A drive is effortless and easy.
A driving horse has scented trouble
A drop of pity in your soul,
A duel must by just and fair,
A dwarf with tail and besides that
A family, where a poor wife
A fancy sayings’ lexicon,
A fan of peaceful Aonides,
A feel is absurd thing for us.
Affecting Russian names, as well
Affect Tatiana; yet, it’s quite
A finely molded magic hook
A fluffy boa on her neck,
A foreign oddity affliction,
A formal answer... yes, of course.
A fortune telling lonely site.
A fragrant old man with gray hair,
A frequent question I do hear...
A friend or enemy, I do
After return to hearth and home,
Again Onegin shows impatience
Again the fantasy is boiling,
Again this anguish and this love!
Again this touch of leg is burning,
Again young lover burned by flame
A gambler and a sergeant guard.
A general makes her escort.
A general, who came with her,
A goblet makes a final hiss,
A goose on reddish feet decided
A goose’s neck a scull does carry,
A granny in a quilted coat,
A grove above the river sleeps
- “A habit, Lensky”. - You are boring
A half a crane and half a cat.
A hamlet, grove and after all
A hammer at a ramrod nocks,
A handsome in the prime of life,
A happy stirrup in my mind...
Ah, darling, Olga is so pure!
Ahead, ahead, arrange the travels
A heap of books, a lonely bed,
A heart of regular coquette!
A heart that beats in tender passion?
A Heaven’s creature, from the Hell
A heavy gossip, old buffoon,
A heroine who will remind
Ah, he did love like nowadays
Ah, maybe then her love and pain
- Ah, nanny, can you give a favor. -
"Ah, nanny, nanny! Am I really
“Ah, nanny, nanny, I am grieving,
A horse can fall when making steps
- Ah, Tanya! Never in these times
A hunter threats to its existence.
Ai is similar to lover -
Airy, magnificent and brilliant,
A kerchief on her gray-haired head.
Alas, again, and all stays still. -
Alas, but the young paramour,
A lash for riding on a stool
Alas! It’s easy to divine!
Alas, no doubt, my Onegin
Alas, Tatiana now is fading,
Alas! The friend for many days,
A letter in her hands, she’s reading,
A light steam swirling under this.
Alike stirred his blood agitation,
Alina, who had read it, yes,
A little pigeon on a lyre
A lively picture’s pallid copy,
All are amazed, Lensky surprised
All causes rapture and surprise.
All clapping. Here’s Onegin coming,
All deeds are blessing, let it be,
All disappeared... Tatiana sighed.
All disappears like empty phrase,
All full of him; nonstop and endless
All her attention switched to that.
All his resentment flew away,
All lots to me looked just the same.
All matters caused argumentations,
All of a sudden Lensky enters,
All of a sudden Olga enters,
All of them in the dreamer’s brain
All of them knew for long already.
All over. Now we hear a gong,
Allover silence, in the distance
All right, you’re leaving, what a pity.
All settled. Thus a plan they make...
All speaks of him. She is annoyed
All stuff that busy London’s merchants
All stuff that he is hearing, seeing
All that didn’t look so entertaining;
All that has now dilapidated,
All that his image purifies
All that looked to Eugene quite new;
All that the study room adorned,
All that, what causes poet’s envy...
All these adornments Olga has.
All these are pointed to her,
“All those should be replaced, no doubt.
All what in Paris hungry taste
All what my soul to fit affording.
All what Onegin knew of that...
Alone, immersed in estimation,
A lonely lake, where darks are nesting,
A lonely private room portray,
Alone, not decorated, dim.
Along a path in the groves’ shadow
A long sharp knife in Eugene’s hand
Along the sleepy corridors
A loser in the love affairs,
A lot of papers, which required
 “A lot of people will be there,
A madrigal at the graveside.
A magic force arose remembrance,
A magic land! There in old years
A maid in hut a thread is spinning;
A mansion glitters on a ground.
Amazes Tania like a wonder,
Ambitiously unconfined,
A medal he got from Suvorov!
A merchant wakes, a pedlar walks,
Am I correct, my dear milords?
A mincing cat on stove is staying,
Am I not glad to resurrection
A mirror to the moon is turning.
Am I the one you did search for,
A mixture of the ranks and years.
Among the fields she had to hold,
Among the ladies and the girls
Among the monsters and the beasts?
Among the people who are fair,
A, morning beam will flash tomorrow
A mournful monument proclaimed...
A Muscovite, who Harold feigns,
A naive girl in thirteen years!
An album of exalted girl
An ardent spirit (quite uncommon),
An ardent thrilling novel author
And absent-minded lorgnettes.
And a dark-eyed blonde’s charming kiss.
And after bring her a guitar...
And after left with solemn words,
And after mother repeats
And after resource estimating,
And after that defame in secret
And after that her look turned tired,
And after waking straight from bed
And aim at his pallid forehead
And all around was in dream,
And all his oddities, that’s why,
And all his youth he hallowed me!
And all my reckless love attempts
And all of them are far from freemen.
And all of them made a conclusion
And all the lights at once blue out,
And all the neighbors entertained.
And all the same, the day, the night...
And all these fancy looking ladies.
And all the subjects she observed
And all the way she wasn’t mute,
And all the way was mute and stern.
And all what gladdens and gives light,
And all, what of me can remind,
And all what pleased my heart at once
And also skinny and too pale,
And also sometimes gnaw a neighbor,
“And also, yes, ... but let’s talk later.
And always biting Shakhovskoy
And always eager to let out
And always hopeless egoism.
And always necessary clowns;
And am not able, never ever,
And am not scared to see the end;
And animated in his mind
And an old man, who saw him chatting,
And anyhow the day is over,
And any other human being,
And a pineapple golden piece.
And are you ready to accept
And as for Larina, I’d say,
And, as I told in the beginning,
And asks the servant to catch up,
And a superior hero offers
And a suspicious old man,
And at a place his ash was laid
And at a see shore on rock wall.
And at same time for all that craving
And at that time the moon was shining
And at the door furtively flicking.
And at the grave in the moonlight
And at the same place memorized
And at the table to the guests
And at your feet burst out sobbing,
And a young lady - city dweller,
And beauty of the sky above,
And became bankrupt in the end.
And beckon boats' sails in the sea.
And bedroom shoes, and serves to him.
And being by a void depressed
And being by regret absorbed
And being by the life affected
And being cared by lucky fate
And being close to hard frustration
And being disarrayed and shy
And being disorientated
And being pleased by festive table
And being satisfied by vengeance
And being shocked like burned by flame
And being stirred by languish feeling
And bends to her with ardor glancing,
And between all the printed lines
And bidding farewell to the girl
And biting epigrams’ harsh style.
And blessed me stepping to the bier.
And Bogdanovich’s perfect rhymes.
And bolder than a healthy man
And boredom of the feast events.
And both of them were close to perish!
And breeding ducks and geese at that
And bring eighteen old jades at last.
And burn and burn just more and more...
And burning solitary dream
And by affected tender eyes
And by alarming dreaming chased,
And by attempting evil fate
And, by his fortune satisfied,
And by his view was not amazed.
And by his visit would be puzzled.
And by Morpheus was embraced
And by severe khandra was chased,
And by the common sense is willed!
And by the Frenchmen being captured
And by the heartache not more troubled
And by the public mobs inspired,
And by the sad burial ground,
And by the slightly noticed splashes
And by the stars falls on the shores.
And by the view of dad and mum
And, by the way, I note in brackets
And by the way, the poet’s mind
And by the way, two words in an add-on...
And by the well-disposed night’s breathing
And call the boisterous old man
And calm, and solitary time.
And can it be that my soul died,
And cannot, cannot stop to read.
And can recite them, here are they...
And can remain in sad distraction,
And can’t believe to his own eyes.
And captives of the Salgir river...
And charming ease in high esteem.
And chases after her like shade;
And cheery like a morning rise,
And cherished hopes, and bright impressions,
And Christmas eve’s majestic cover.
And could drop tears, which were a play!
And could not stop to think about
And could you find in this lady,
And counts hours again.
And covered by acacia shades,
And covered by the silky veils
And cram, and shine and exaltation,
And crossing to the table goes.
And cuckold, who looks always nice,
And curses all that her surrounds,
And dames’ attire, smart and proud,
And dare not interrupt his speech.
And dashing song of remote singer...
And dazzled by an expectation
And despite radiant Phoebus threat
And did it to the health of neighbor.
And did it with no hesitation,
And did not bring to him confession.
And did not die of grief at last.
And did not follow the sweet habit,
And did not rush against the nature.
And did not stir him anymore.
And didn't bore him with strict moral,
And dip the jugs, where pipe is playing.
And ditches of the Russian brand.
And does it almost every day,
And does it well till nowadays
And does not play in the midday
And does not see him, not at all!
And do imagine one same thing -
And doing it with vacant look
And domesticity don’t like,
And do not hear my wistful cry.
And do not make a step aside!
And don’t depict a gorgeous view.
And do translate the virgin’s passions
And do you not at all despise
And drew my lively frisky Muse
And drink Bordeaux - a prudent wine.
And drives a doggy at full force;
And drives back home to go to bed;
And drops of tears, and at the bed
And during Russian Shrovetide feast
And easy life, my novel’s friend!
And elegized the child’s plays,
And entertaining books, at that
And envy people’s evil tortures.
And Eugene only did remind.
And even keep in touch with him.
And even nicer with persistence
And everywhere in front of you
And ex-advisor Mr. Flyanoff -
And execrates long stay of these.
And faintly whispered... isn’t it nice?
And fancy looking odds and cranks.
And far niente is my law.
And fascinates by bliss and calm.
And feared like a chased fallow deer;
And feeling braver and less shy
And feel quite lonely in their world,
And feels of those did not neglect.
And fighting pushed the dogs away,
And finally decided that
And finally had seen beau monde.
And finally in bed while dreaming
And finally she gave a sigh...
And finally they've packed the sledges
And finally to live in vain
And finally, when music ends,
And fixed his hair by fingers brush.
And fluid vividness of these
And Flyanov, being not fine fettle,
And followed fashions being strict.
And following a solemn crowd
And for a few days after that
And for a long time he was sad.
And for the first time clicks a cock.
And for the glory honey craving
And friendly goblet of the wine
And full of premonitions, sad,
And gallops being deadly shocked.
And gives an answer... Agafon.
And glances of the maids around.
And glory him in future ages;
And grant his soul salvation, please!”
And guild of writers was disfavored.
And had accepted that demand.
And had decided... it deserved
And had forgotten the Gods’ speech,
And hands to her his pearl himself.
And hand to me a rightful staff,
And has not they converted now
And having lots of things to deal
And healthy, send regards to you.
And hearing your majestic splashes
And heaved a sigh, when he did see it.
And he believed, there is a soul,
And he directs lorgnette to her.
And he had found quite distinct...
And he, indifferent to passions,
And he kept off their noisy sessions
And he perceived the magic tales.
And he recalled sweetheart Tatiana’s
And he sometimes disturbed her soul?
And he was Benedetta purring
And he was joyful being glad
And he was seized by a displeasure,
And hiding far away from people
And hire a carriage for a drive.
And his from fitting room appearance
And his Imagination dreams
And his lorgnette aside aligning
And hoarfrost in a sunny day,
And honored dweller of backstage,
And how a human can survive,
And how expressively could speak!
And how for long?” - Soon for two years. -
And how the high society gathers -
And hurries to the groves and fields,
And husbands’ friendship so unfair!
And I am grateful for your care.
And I am sure you will find
And I am thankful for enjoying
And I began to plan and cherish
And I believe (myself I flatter!)
And I complied with crowd’s fashions
And I confess escaped from these,
And I (confessing with a sigh)
And I confess to you with shame
And I don’t really know why,
And if I have a chance to choose,
And I got married. Thus, I say,
And I, maybe, by sad doom followed
And in a drawing room they meet
And in a squat dance jumps and spins.
And in a sulk made a decision
And in his mind he is transferred
And in his nook spends all the days.
And in his nook the sage of desert
And in his songs with pride retained
And in his study’s taciturn
And in hush tone to nanny speaks...
And in last chapter’s very end
And in my garden now she stands,
And in the childish pranks and plays
And in the garden like close friends
And in the lonely silent study
And in the love they did not trust.
And in the midday’s wavy space -
And in the morning read a book;
And in the open air keeps strolling
And in the parents’ native home
And in the silent idle quiet
And in the sky geese caravans
And in the speeches’ uselessness,
And in this very-very instant
And I, remembering Svetlana,
And I should add an honest man...
And is khandra in Russian term),
And isn't this lady he just saw
And it produces my heart thrilling
And it replaces good and love.
And it will chase him all his life,
And jealous whisper of the wives
And just an instant far ago
And just like knowing all of it
And Knyazhnin made the public dizzy.
And kvass like air was necessary,
And ladies' legs, but am in doubt,
And languishing it’s searching for
And later in a lonely site
And launch the rhymes to operation.
And leaning on a granite shelf
And leaves the bed, raises the blinds.
And leave Tatiana for a while,
And left just never being captured
And left the other world to visit.
And Lensky can’t withstand the stroke.
And Lensky in his mind seething
And Lensky properly enrage.
And Lensky wandering in drowse
And let my Muse to animate...
And like a flying arrow rides.
And like a simpleton he fell.
And like I did in days of old
And like Onegin left world’s vain,
And listened to bailiff’s reports,
And little by little he got seized
And looking at the moon she told...
And looking serious persuade
And looks more neat than parquet tiling.
And loved to follow the rules strictly.
And loves himself beyond all measure.
And love the country’s modest trend,
And loving scope the mind ties,
And made a bow without straining.
And maidens’ room; yet, I confess,
And makes a turn at a nice nook.
And make the bashful soul so sick!
And make the friendship sweet and meek.
And, maybe, his unhappy shade
And, maybe, on the public stages
And, maybe, sometimes willed by heaven,
And maybe tenderly than that.
And more than that, once in a battle
And move the desk; I will be ready
And must arrange the Christmas meetings,
And my Onegin in a dream
And my Tatiana, little by little,
And my Zaretsky that is why
And native magazines didn’t read.
And nestled at my head in dark?
And never asked for spouse permissions.
And never reading them had found
And never used to give them lessons
And never will be back again?
And none of them would ever waver
And not a speck of ink, do note.
And nothing can affect his sleep,
And nothing can her soul excite.
And nowadays from you, my dear,
And now a page you’re turning over,
And now, in chapter number five
And now rejoicing in his vision
And now the day and sleepless night
And now the objects for desire
And now they’ll separately stay.
And now you search for my disgrace,
And obscured neighborhood landscape,
And of my heart so doleful breaths.
And of the damsel took best care.
And of the duel be aware.
And of the lyre harmonic plays
And Olga too had started yawning,
And on a silver water pane
And one of these she’s taking out,
And on her shoulder bends his head...
And only good to you will say?
And only the young girl stands lonely
And on the last one you are reading...
And on the right a puzzling figure -
And opens entrance doors with keys.
And other books didn’t recognize.
And over it a Scottish plaid;
And Pelageya Pantelevna
And, pensively, the cherished name
And people hustled in the parlor.
And people’s talk, and horses’ clatter!
And people will be for that thankful.
And pepped up by the vernal beams
And planned to show the modern fashion
And play this miserable role,
And pleasantness of a nice wife.
And pool the wool over the eyes,
And pour the spicy bitter words,
And pressed his finger to the cock.
And pretty sex like fluff is flying.
And probably for many days.
And proud coldness in the air,
And pushed Tatiana both at once,
And put in pawn the estates’ land.
And puts Tatiana on the floor.
And rainbow on the snow induce.
And ran away, I was pursued.
And reading them, a word by word,
And redcurrants besides these.
And remained sitting afterwards.
(And rhymes, so far as I can tell);
And river’s surface gay and bright
And roams alone in woods in fields. -
And run to unrestricted span.
And Russian N in French did write;
And sacred poetry’s illusions?
And said... "You wrote me, don’t deny it,
And sanctify by tender novel.
And save humanity from tortures;
And saying that he drained a glass
And say politely “Bye, grandpas!”
And scarcely will deserve high rate.
And searching for a rhyme in verse
And see a lonely sad gravestone,
And seeing them looked very sad.
And sentimental city dames,
And serf had blessed the divine grace.
And shall repay to you for that,
And shall return to him, believe me,
And shame of vice and other fault,
And sharp and ice cold style of mind.
And she admires all this chaos,
And she agrees to dance with him.
And she begins to squeak (my God!)
And she examines with attention
And she has no force to run more.
And she her former master blesses...
And she is scared and is attempting
And she is sitting... She again!
And she perceived his obscure gaze
And she preferred illusions’ tongue
And she pronounced... that is him!
And she was boring all the way.
And she was sighing for a guy,
And she, who by my Muse was featured
And shorter had become the day,
And shortly ringing voice of Olga
And shortly to the mill arrived.
And should it be my fortune’s willing
And shows his real soul’s affection.
And shuffles cards like faro plays.
And signet t. a v. Annette;
And singing songs to church conveyed.
And snorts; the rider being worried
And snow is whirled by sudden blow,
And so amusingly translated,
And so far in a morning clothing,
And solitude of the nice nook,
And something sparkled in her heart;
And something stirred inside of him,
And speed full tilt to make it quick,
And spoke singsong and deeply sighed;
And spring doesn’t please it, doesn’t excite?
And squeezes gently Olga’s arm.
And standing leaning on a door
And started dashing headlong race
And started like a pilgrim roaming
And starts to talk of this of that.
And stirred by a sincere sorrow
And stirred the common agitation.
And Strasburg pie so neatly lies
And strolling in the forests’ peace
And strolls without purpose, sad...
And super peerless Grandison,
And takes a pen to write the verses,
And Tanya does not feel so feared,
And Tanya hiding agitation,
And Tanya’s charming youth is chilling...
And tea is served; and I have found...
And tell how much each other misses.
And tender dreams in flaming soul.
And Terpsichore is only one,
And thanks to that I shall acquire
And thank you, God, for the assistance,
And that by jealousy promote;
And that is why we often find
And that’s how they were growing old.
And that Vladimir plans to marry
And the black curls to shoulders long.
And the grandsons will oust us
And the inflamed imagination,
And their creative Muses’ blaze
And their seductive figuration
And their selection puzzled her,
And the judicious conversations
And then, anew, as always idle
And the new sorrow learned for real,
And, then, he dressed...
And, then, present it for reviewing
And then presents his friend and kin.
And then report you in detail,
And then with puzzle in her gaze
And the old fashioned wig did set.
And there, instead of oh, belle Nina
And the same spitz and the same spouse,
(And these are probably same matter)
And they all stopped attempts to deal
And they are painful besides this.
And they arranged for staying guests
And they retained in calm and peace
And they take pistols after that.
And they went home circling the garden;
And they will touch somebody’s heart,
And think... Oh gosh, when will you die!”
And thinks that he is beloved still,
And think that life is light forever.
And thirst for knowledge and for work,
And this invaluable creation
And this prescribes the spa to him.
And though he is unknown to you
And though he loved the life to throttle,
And thoughts and feelings of young man,
And thought, what would be its content;
And thunderstorms of midnight revels.
And thus, eight times positions changed.
And thus, feel jealous and confused.
And thus, in French she used to write.
And thus, I switched to a strange being ...
And, thus, preferring Grandison
(And, thus, reminds me something).
And, thus, she finally pronounced
And, thus, Tatiana everyday
And thus, the tyranny of passions
And tinsel of the fashion style,
And to a fiddlestick obedient
And to arose the ladies smile
And to a scanty language switched
And to eighteen years sage belonged.
And to expose to them the features
And to make calming down review
And to me like Bacchante facing
And to provoke derisions then!
And to repent I can’t afford
And to Tatiana every year
And to the front till now it places
And to the same conformist neighbor
And to your daughters pay attention,
And tried to catch her tender eyes;
And tried to read them, but what for?
And tries to cry, but fails to get
And truffles - splendor for the youth,
And trusting to the wife completely
And under her angelic stare
And used in solitude to stay,
And used to say... when would it be?”
And Vanya younger was than me.
And very often idle speeches
And very soon the stormy feels
And Vesper is hailed by a cock.
And virgins catch by praise and sighs;
And vowed that he will take revenge
And warely steps on squeaky floor;
And was annoyed with high life’s roar;
And was escorted by the glasses
And was not, yet, eighteen years old.
And wasn’t it you, of whom was thinking
And wasn’t it you, whom I heard speaking,
And wasn’t she by this trouble ruined
And was sincerely inspired
And watches how the snow is piling,
And watches people with stern face
And watching through lorgnette the world
And watching through lorgnette the world
And we are by the court caressed,
(And we call this romanticism?
And weepy verses had inscribed
And were engaged in song performing.
And Werther by the passions chained,
And what a languishing blessed stirring
And what a lively inspiration
And what a passions’ storm at that
And what a serious attention
And what a vicious derision,
And what? By the love saturated
And what did me at all that wonder?
And what did never learn his mind,
And what? Don’t worry. I calm down
And what? His eyes continued reading,
And what is he? Is he just fiction,
- And what? - “Not she would stir my feeling,
And what resulted from the meeting?
And what so far he will prefer?
“And what?” - Tatiana’s name-day party,
And what today, what odd affairs,
And what was it in snowdrift’s groove?
And when a falling star in sky
And when appeared were met by hosts
And when a splendid noble lady
And when at last she was alone,
And when he wanted to wipe out
And when in parlor clock chimes five,
And when it happened her to sight
And when something had stirred his blood
And when the childhood was over,
And when the country night is coming,
And when the nanny used to gather
And where is this ambiguous figure,
And where my heart I’ve given up.
And where’s her sister passing time?
And where today this glum crank stays,
And which today I’ve left behind.
And whispered both to her at that...
And whisper visiting my urn...
And Whitsun round dances much,
And who is he? Is it Onegin?
“And who is she?” She’s Larins, nee. -
And whom this time he’ll try to feign?
And who with no wine could inspire!
And why to play in love should not
And will be by a grove amused
And will be faithful all my life”.
And will gain nothing, never ever;
And wind, the morning sunrise worth,
And wine like comet jets to cup,
And winter’s splendid bliss admired.
And with a book still stays in bed,
And with a fear leaned on the paw.
And with a swagger analyze
And with cherries pelt him, then,
And with her husband she slipped off...
And with no words unnecessary
And with Onegin still remains.
And with that faith in life still live;
And with the groves and lovely vales
And with the wife he had to go.
And woody knolls of native place,
And words amicable expression?
And would be glad to see a body,
And would not you forgive to her
And, wow! From local town’s suburb
And, wow, they bring so nicely bottled
And yawning calmly and speechless
And yawning calmly and speechless
And yawning listened to a prayer;
And you, my favorable reader,
And you, my Idol, fair and true,
And you so living and continual
And you, superbly looking albums,
And you, the countryside Priams,
And you, the forests I do love,
And you, the mothers, be more strict
And you, young pretties (not the ladies),
A neighbor belfry’s early toll
A neighbor sniffs in front a neighbor,
An elegy prepares to her.
An epigram stirs in my soul,
An evil fellow or good man?
Anguish of love drives Tanya out,
An idol with the clinched crossed hands
A nightingale starts singing song
An independent lively will,
An inexperienced soul’s excitement
Anisiya instantly appears,
Annoying to me, then, did cause
Annoy us less than use to do that
An obscured something in remote.
An old abandoned sleigh required,
An olden crippled man is turning
An old postilion with a beard
A note to one whom is admiring.
Another archly smiled in doubts,
Another fate is waiting me…
Another former spring arouse,
Another!.. No, it is quite fatal,
Another poet earned success,
An uhlan captured Olga’s soul.
An uhlan lulled her and quite shortly
An uncared park by the thick shadows
A passionate and reckless letter.
A pensive shelter for Dryads.
A person should be slain with care
(A pleasure for effete young man),
A poet, and with Kant in love.
A poet who’s eighteen years old?
Appeared at home starched brazen guy,
Appeared in front of me like phantoms!
Appeared Katenin and did dare
Appeared like light majestic vision,
Appeared together, and no one
Appeared to me and brought to thrill,
Appeared to me in dreams, and I
Appears in front. It looks so solemn.
Approves this rational advice,
A problematic entertainment
A racing sleigh waits at the entrance,
Are all like that, and he’s the same;
Are all your kinfolk in good health?
Are always welcomed with much care
Are beaming brightly through the branches
Are either despondent Vampire
A reformation in estate.
A regiment of lenders brought him
Are leveled with a fluffy plaid.
Are lightly covered golden coals,
Are loaded, and the lamps of night
Are never ready to conceal
Are pretty tired of the harness.
Are so deceptive... like feet’s traces!
Are speeding along cobbled roadways,
Are they the foes?! For how long they
Are vanity, and I’ll be glad
Are whitewashed, there is no more host.
- Are you acquainted? - Yes and not.
Are you a seeker for a shadow?
Are you the same? Or other houris
Are you the same? Or other huris
Argue with you, but won’t do that,
Aristocrats and army dandies
Arose in him aversion, so
Arousing love for them is crime,
A row of jugs with apple wine,
Arranges table at fireside.
As a keepsake they used to rhyme,
As always eats and drinks all day.
As an Ideal and high praised…
As a princess I now appear,
A sash of silk the girl took off;
As before stir my heart to tremble,
As between wolf and dog). That’s fine.
As brother’s killer, that is why
A scandalmonger, that’s the deal...
Ascends upwards from burning ovens,
A scholar, but a prig, as well,
As consolation to me whispered
As did the pretty charming minor,
A secret of the nuptial bed,
A sensitive and tender fellow
A sentimental moral tale,
A set of scissors, curved and straight,
A set of vulgar folkish fables,
A severe punishment for that!
As for the castles it should be...
As girlfriend of my sad existence,
A shade of night is calmly slipping,
A shepherd horn broke in the drowse,
A shepherd’s horn far away playing.
A shepherd weaving bast shoe sings
A sickness of an unknown kind,
As in the past she used to be.
As of the sins of youthful times
A song of Volga’s fishermen.
A spark of tenderness you showed,
A special charm in conversations.
A speechless monument to passions,
A splinter crackles smokes and lights.
As Poet had portrayed himself.
As pretty Finish young girl’s beau!
As pushed by the ancestral rite,
As real sage and noble man,
As Sadi used to say sometimes.
A stall, a fence and nothing more.
A steam is swirling making coils.
A storm did breathe, the charming blossom
A stranger reads inscription there...
A supper follows, say good night,
A swarm of thoughts in him conceived.
A swarm of young unfaithful lovers,
As was described by Lafontaine...
As was established by the olds.
As we have mentioned at right place,
As well as all infernal spooks,
At a side column with two aunts.
A tasteful lunch, when it’s convenient,
At beauty’s legs in the affection
At bicorn new moon’s pretty face,
At dawn, a shepherd at the hill
At Eugene turned her distant look
At first all neighbors gave him visits,
At first, a Madame cared and nursed,
At first I wanted to keep silent;
At first, Onegin’s language was
At flatness of the femme du monde,
At heart an ignorant naive,
At high society men’s wrong tone,
A thirst for ruling over omen...
At home awaiting for response,
At home he sleeps without trembling;
At home, since barely drag my feet.
At home was sleeping like a log.
- At Larins. - “That looks pretty nice.
At least a chip of feel and sense.
At least, for fame he was conceived;
At least regret they demonstrated,
At least, remember my advice...
At least respect to my young years.
At least the sounds of their talks
At least three balls used to give yearly
At least two verses he could find.
At Lensky stricken Eugene stares.
At liberty I’ll play and revel,
At lies of magazines, at war,
At night starts singing in the dale.
At nobly measured sound distance;
At obscure novel and so on.
At oversweeten tea and sweetie,
At poetasters yells... “do stop
Attention to himself by that).
Attention to the young men’s tales
Attentive, listless or convenient!
At that night period of time,
At that time I preferred to care.
At the main road appears at night.
At the old lime trees and a well,
At the old mill to have a meeting,
At the poor virgin; they guffaw,
At the same time nearby arrived
At these the intent damsel gazes,
At the unfinished rhymes does not
Attracts a novel, which she reads,
At window sitting all the day.
Averted, yawned and did conclude...
A vivid day will start to play.
Avoided public life’s uproar,
Avoids to glance at scary shaggy.
Avoid to drop a curtsy; and
A waxen jug was placed on table -
Away. Door opens, Eugene looks,
Away from vanity and fame,
A whisper spread in the state hall...
A windmill flaps and cracks by wings
A witch with beard behaves like mad,
A wolf chased by his hungry fellow
A worthless phantom with pretense,
A worthy mansion was erected
A youthful poet and bold fellow
Babushka says... ”Here’s a fireside,
Backed to Akul’ka from Selina
Back to the blossoms, novels’ heroes,
Ballets awake in me just bore,
Barking of pugs, noise, laughter, hustle,
Bark, laughter, singing, whistle, scamper,
Bassoon and flute at once did start.
Be a mean slave of sense and fame?
Beating in seizures by the wing,
Became the comedies le roi;
Because his features pleased my brain...
Because of them I skipped sometimes
Bed bugs and fleas at the road stays
Before a hand is stained with blood?
Beforehand yawning in post-chase,
Before right term to follow dad.
Began to aim, but at that time
Began to cough and then to weep.
Began to think of something else.
Began to walk restraining feeling,
Begins to drip refreshing rain),
Behave like your foremother Eva...
Behind a door the cries and clinks,
Being afraid of jealous blaming,
Being a kid in children’s crowd
Being by music roar inspired,
Being embraced by fatal fears.
Being forgotten lonely lying.
Being forsaken for long days.
Being immersed into the dreaming
Being inflamed by purest passion.
Being like flighty hope, like fairy,
Being naively nice like fairy,
Belated judgements and reactions, -
Believe in what her heart has told?
Believe me (conscience is my bail)
- Believe me... truly... my behavior...
Believe me, you would never know
Belongs to other one and no one
Below the others’ words and signs,
Be reputed as feigned eccentric
Besides, for them he also hired
Besides, it starts the joy and fun -
Besides, perhaps, of secret fear.
Besides the melancholic stay?
Besides, the nature’s self-expression,
Besides, they are so chaste and pure,
Besides they find that she’s weird,
Besides, this old duelist guy
Between a slice of Limburg cheese
Between beefsteak and cold dissert
Beware of books he had no ground
Bewitched by magic dark of night.
Beyond his comprehension signs,
Beyond the threshold of the being
Bitterly cried and could not stop.
Blessed is a modest lover really,
Blessed is the one, who has left early
Blessed is the one, who’s on time matured,
Blessed is the one, who’s young from youth,
Blessed is who witted exaltation,
Booths, peasants, sledges, city noise,
Born at a garret by a liar
Both bored when gathering together,
Both, gorgeous blossoms and sweet fruits.
Both, love and rhythms and by that doubled
Both, modern room and ancient hall.
Both sisters brings to my Eugene,
Both, very true and purely fibs,
Both were expecting in young days
Bows, misses' kisses, shuffling, jam,
Bribe taker, glutton and fair fool.
Bring to us through the Baltic waves
Broad-minded, there’s no reproach,
Bronze on the table, chinaware,
Brought with a bunch of other wise
Bukharians, boulevards and cloisters,
But after falling gravely ill
But after Tanya’s note receiving,
But a grand general right there
“But all in elegy is poor,
But all in vain, Martyn Zadeka
But all the same, to them the hope
But always simply yes or no”.
But any novel take and read,
But a princess, aloof, cold-blooded,
But ardent youngsters, it’s no doubt,
But (are there rules with no exception?)
But at same time, you should agree,
But at the province town's courts
But before gets an invitation
But being worn by night time pleasure,
“But boredom troubles me, my friend!”
But Breguet watch’s bell reminds...
But by Torquato octave rhymes
But cannot get a clear answer,
But cannot get rid of the lackey.
But clinking of the spurs we hear,
But conversations of their wives
But dangled after them somehow;
But did it make my Eugene happy,
But do not know how to translate,
But enmity in high-society
But even in the adolescence
But fatty pasty that time was
But finally a deep sigh heaving,
But finally, before sunrising
But finally he is aroused
But for the former - hope expires,
But for the virgin youthful hearts
But funny stories of the ancient
But gushing out hissing foam
But hears behind the bear’s step!
But heart ache is an acid matter,
But he, at that, prefers the minor,
But he cooled off routine existence.
But he is glad that former stay
But he is sleeping and doesn’t care.
But he is stubborn, does not stop
But here I see another trouble...
But he was wrong... as always merry
But he was wrong... that time Onegin
But he will beat for you his breast...
But hush! You hear? A critic strictly
But I don’t want to praise you, yet,
But if to be sincere and just,
But I in love was dumb and still.
But in her breast she feels same stir,
But in my north, the summer season
But insofar, I see no ground
But in the album of young Olga
But in the frosty winter time
But in the late and fruitless years,
But in the midst of dismal rocks
But in the next day’s early morning
But I return to my fair lady.
But I shall bring to it new fame
But it a paw with sharp long claws
But it chimes ten and to the entrance
But it is late, the light has faded,
But it was late and time for leaving;
But it was really expressive,
“But I was born not for a pleasure;
But just he fell into oblivion
But just no features have retained.
But Larina was dragging slowly,
But Lensky blushed, could not that stay...
But Lensky not at all desired
But let it be, what can I do,
But let it be, your care revealing
But little by little and the quiet
But look... ah..! Please, do not neglect. -
But love yourself and don’t complain,
But managed only one accord,
But, maybe, all that is worth free
But, maybe, for the world’s well-being,
But, maybe, pictures of that kind
But maybe’s delayed by the mail. -
But maybe sometimes prayers thanks
But maybe you can still discover
But meal is served, and in a row
But me... why should it bother me?
But mind sought for something more;
But my fate is resolved already!
But my Onegin spent the evening
But my poor Lensky... yes, he was
But neither you, nor friends of yours,
But no confusion she did show
But no decision she can make.
But North is not for me, they say.
But not today, though, I sincerely
But nowadays the minds are foggy,
But nowadays, the sad gravestone
But now a kind easy man,
But now all drawn in darkness, Tanya...
But now it’s not right thing to purpose,
But now not that disturbs my brain.
But now, the pompous neighbor brings
“But now too late, the time flew by...
But now, when looking at its face,
But of myself and nothing else.
But Olga was not fond of these.
But on the third day of the staying
But on the whole, their naive chat
But pantaloons, frack and gilet,
“But perish from him I won’t mind.
But pitiful is who foresees,
But pleased me by the magic tales,
But, probably, want to amaze
But quitted suddenly, that’s why
But she can’t do it. No? But why?
But she, whom my poetic lyre
But shortly changing of a place
But should not they just start to laugh
But since he used at the back porch
But something happened in the chaos,
But sometimes distant signs of hope
But sometimes I was keen and bold,
But soon all that was finalized;
But still retains the sense and gumption.
But stir up rage and make it boil.
But sudden fear has seized Tatiana...
But suddenly all that has changed
But suddenly a snowdrift moved,
But suddenly a wind did puff,
But summer comes to very late.
But Tanya feels like in a sleep.
But Tanya weep and cry could not,
But tea is served... the maidens slowly
“But tell me, nanny, how’s your wedding?”
But Terpsichore’s cute leg, however,
But that’s all right, I say good by
But that’s enough, enough, I say...
But that’s enough. It’s time for me
But that’s enough to relish ravage.
But, then, again reflective, gloomy
But then, by household distracted,
But then delayed because they failed
But then, obedient to the nature,
But then resigned with no regret,
But then to make it even worse.
But there’s no star, which is more bright
But there, where stormy Melpomen
But the right words he cannot find.
But they, ...for madrigals they call!
But they with cry undid by braid,
But this so serious distraction
But thrifty neighbor was in pouts,
But thud of horses' hoofs appearing
But time for us will come, yes, really,
But to admit it feels disgrace.
But to believe I did not dare,
But to continue my life way,
But to the second, to the third
But was not smart enough to care.
But we… by nothing being famed,
But we were trapped by destiny
But what a boredom is the session...
But what is friendship? We consider
But when he’d reached the one who’s leaving,
But when the turn Onegin reaches,
But which of these had made a fortune,
But whisper and the fools’ guffaw...
“But who is she?” - She is my wife. -
But who is sitting over there,
But who is there in elite crowd,
- But why are you so negative,
But will and mind had prevailed,
But with his soul at tete-a-tete
But you are already prepared!
But you, Bordeaux, like a close friend,
But you don’t see in them the changes,
But you’re not listening to me... -
But you, so odd and scattered volumes
But you, the beauty all above,
But you, the husbands, were so kind
But you, the youthful inspiration,
But you, to whom at friendly meeting
By Adam Smith was really pleased,
By a good willed and sinless wife
By a home circle like all do,
By all what happened she is puzzled.
By amour flatter conquered her;
By ancient rite they celebrated
By A.S. Pushkin
By aunts’ and mothers’ watch and care
By a young lady of the house,
By billet-doux on seven pages,
By blizzard snowed stay in a drowse.
By bold and biting epigram;
By breakfast, dinner and tea brake;
By caring hands of an unknown.
By chance I have retained these verses
By charming finger was amending...
By cheery muddy water streams.
By children and his faithful wife,
By crimson beams of the sunrise.
By divine train in calm appear.
By dreams she used to decorate
By easy quitrent had replaced,
By exclamations, bread and salt...
By fate is taken far away,
By fireside spleen exercising.
By former simple habitation,
By girlfriends’ oeuvres overall,
By god of inspiration blessed
By good intention being driven,
By gossip, tears, rings, weepy rhymes,
By grievous premonitions chased,
By her good looks and kind soul.
By high society’s dissipation,
By his brush nimbly decorated
By his foolhardiness displeased.
By hooded carts, by open sleds.
By its description in details;
By jealous anguish and depression.
By languor light illumining
By liberty and glory pleased,
By long drive carriage or post-chaise,
By loving soul all your perfection,
By lulling of the thoughts and sense.
By mannered posture he advanced;
By moving heads of noble dames
By my sad mystery explain.
By naive pastime entertained,
By nakedness annoying you.
By neighbors visits she’s not pleased,
By noble impulses of soul
By Olga’s merits more and more
By Olga’s nice smile animated
By one quick foot the other beats.
By pawn takes rook, but not of hers.
By pencil scribbled words and signs.
By phantoms of the vanished day...
By picture of a happy love
By pleasant words the people told
By pleasing flattery impress,
By puzzlement the heart disturb
By reading Cicero displeased.
By reading to him tragic book
By rhythms and anguish being pined
By Russian hammers treat the tires
By seeming fears, by oaths and prayers,
By silver were embellished trees,
By singer of Corsair inspired,
By soul performed exalted flight?
By soul performed exalted flight?
By steady, firm and sound gait.
By stern behavior they made ground
By stretched on sofa sick princess.
By sudden epigrams’ brisk style.
By sweet caress had made a prize
By the creators, whom believes, -
By the desires slowly gnawed,
By the last fame intoxicated,
By the life habit pretty spoilt,
By the light jest or other lies.
By the new world’s uproar and shine
By the suggestions hinted at
By this so meek and nice surround,
By this unfaithfulness been shocked?
By ugly bogs replaces meadows;
By vanity, then, hope exciting
By vision of a nice far place,
By waving tawdry gown she fails),
By wavy carpets covered fields.
By which his stormy time was shining;
By wise discussions of past time
By wish to switch to other sites
By worthy of reproaching glance!
By worthy of your lofty feeling
By your neglection penalize.
By Zeus’s supreme will elected
Cabmen with faces red like lobsters,
Calls to the tree of good and evil...
Calm down burning heart at least.
Came in and at the window sat. -
Came true just only in your dreams,
Came visit the burial site.
Can catch her fancy and then ruin
Can I depict my true impression,
Cannot avoid despise to men,
Cannot change that despite of fashion,
Cannot deny it... yes, it has.
Cannot resolve misgivings, yet,
Can not the avid lips deprive
Can replace happiness, but find
Can she be here? Oh, yes ... But, no...
Can you divine, where’s Eugene speeding?
Can you imagine, I’m alone,
Can you let me see your Phyllida,
“Can you show me the landlord’s mansion?” -
Can you tell me, who’s there Tatiana?”
Captured his mind, anyway,
Caress and take of them good care,
Caressed in oriental comfort,
Casts at Tatiana a stiff gaze,
Caught fame and glory by God’s will.
Caused by the years, which passed away
Chadaev’s copy, my Onegin,
Chaldean sage, who clarifies
Change one another... it’s the law

Chateaubriand used to explain.
Checks for the words complied with sense...
Chilled sparkling wine; yes, it was served
Chronic complain of soul insight,
Clap hands and idle masters scold.
Clarissa, Julia, Dauphin,
Clears out through a morning steam.
Clothed by the storms with waves I’ll quarrel,
Coldblooded lechery sometimes
Collate Onegin with me, gosh,
Come to my chamber made of gold!
Commands from elegy take off
Compassioned, on a bunch of herb
Completely to her love surrendering,
Completing evil undertaking
Complied with feelings, purposeless,
Composed by Virgil or Racine,
Composing intricate blackwash
Conceived for all these dreams and drowse.
Concerned with your slow witting mind?
Confess like you with no dissembling,
Confide to her the private things,
Controlled by Providence’s will;
Coquette makes judgment in cold mind,
Cosmopolite or patriot?
Cotillion was so long and boring,
Could be high valued and esteemed,
Could cause to quarrel the young men,
Could change his soul, the same desire
Could ever say, when being candid,
Could hold his tongue or make it fun,
Could I again hear your great chorus,
Could I again hear your great chorus,
Could I see Russian Terpsichore’s
Could I see Russian Terpsichore’s
Could never ever recognize.
Could not by same attraction prize.
Could not eclipse her modest neighbor.
Could not relax or pacify.
Could respond keenly or look dull,
Could speak good French and wrote as well;
Could value his romantic gifts,
Cowberry water for the neighbor,
Cowberry water troubles me,
Craved for a fatal heart relief;
Crossed Tanya with a senile hand.
Damask wallpaper in the parlor,
Dared polish nails in front of him,
Deceases suddenly, the minion
Decided to accept this option
Decided to despise the flirt,
Decided to stay home alone;
Declines his horns and sees his face,
Declining languid head at that;
Delirium and passion flares.
(Denying prejudice as fake)
Departs, reconciliation moments;
Depicted charming females’ legs
Depicting by his ardent rhymes
Depicting modern world and style,
Depicts a hero, whom he loves
Depicts by pen and colors fine;
Despise to me will be extended!
Despite of all her marble splendor
Despite the common sense approach,
Despite the pain he doesn’t stop play;
(Despite well-reasoned deprecation)
Destroy the prejudice perceptions,
Devoid of any animation,
Devoting his poetic song
Diana’s breast and cheeks of Flora
Did, do and always will extend
Did ever any weepy poet
Didlo doesn’t stir me anymore”.
Did not compress her lips, I swear!
Did not display the moon reflection,
Did not get mad, the life didn’t finish.
Did not reiterate by chance
Didn’t ever touch a sewing needle,
Didn’t keep away from high life’s rabbles,
Didn’t make a novelty to you.
Didn’t pay attention to her deals,
Didn’t scare at all nobodies’ ears.
Didn’t want to spoil the child’s rest,
Did search in these nonchalant verses,
Did stir the youthful breast by flame,
Did strike a bullet in the aim.
Did try to blame them for the done...
Did turn to her from armchair rows.
Did you emit a doleful moan
Dies in the violins’ roars and cries.
Diminishes and goes away,
Discuss of all Onegin’s virtues
Discuss the matter, heave the breaths,
Disdains, subjects to expertise,
Disliked these awfully, and then
Dismal appearance and pail colors;
Dispensing alms or when was seeking
Dispersed still being in a fly,
Displayed a verdict he was worth.
Display my fortune to your view...
Disturb a dream of my soul now.
Disturbed him giving no escape.
Disturbed the calm all of a sudden.
Disturb my heart... I realize
Disturbs my stomach, that is why
Disturb the maidens’ sleeps and plays,
Diversely repeat same things,
Do drag away from city’s gates.
Does foreign fashion cunning lyrist
Does not comply with modern trend.
Does not produce attractive vision
Doesn’t breathe the frost air as before,
Doesn’t dare to trouble by a rhyme,
Doesn’t kiss dames’ hands, doesn’t bow politely,
Doesn’t know what is deceit and can
Doesn’t push the cows from shed for feeding,
Doesn’t try to imitate somebody,
Doesn’t understand, what do they chat,
Doesn’t use first snow from roof of banya
Doesn’t want to share her secrets, yet,
Doing it straight or otherwise.
Do love the hero of my tale,
Do not come to gaze at us,
Do not let travelers to nap;
Do not make interest to you,
Don’t blame and do not find strange!
Don’t do again same thing you did,
Don’t hunt for glory’s fake adornments.
Don’t let the poet’s soul to still,
Don’t spend your energy in vain,
Don’t want to read? - Then, prices quote,
Door opens; who’s there? Olga calling;
Dose not say yes, ma’am, or no, sir,
Do stroll under the Finish sky

Do you remember Grandison?”
Do you remember this nice place,
Drag after you on chance relying.
Draw female's legs, heads and so forth;
Dreams, wishes, grieves of human being
Drinks from a tumbler just red wine;
Drive tightly packaged bags and trunks
Dropped shoe or book into the fire.

Drowned us in fade romanticism

Embellished with the paints and rhymes...
Embraced by mad regret and grief
Emerging from a nearby valley.
Empting a cup she song to guests,
Enamored, simple and artless,
Enchanting Muse illuminated
Enjoyed the baths on Saturdays,
Enjoyed this careless languor being,
Enjoys in peace the Great Beyond.
Enjoy yourself my dear fellow!
Enjoy your visiting to us,
Enough! I am my soul employing
Enough, my darling... They are fine
Enough, my friend, enough, no odds!
Enough, my friend, for sake of God.
Enough, no bonds and no more tiring!
“Enough, please, listen for a while.
Enough, please, sing another song!”
Enquired gently, who is that,
Enters a parlor, no one, yet,
Erasing inscribed by a blow.
E sempre bene, gentlemen.
Esteemed his spirit, also valued
Eternal deep chorus of waves,
Eternal Jew or brave Corsair
Eugene is now the only owner
Eugene now does not dwell there, yet...
Eugene Onegin
Eugene Onegin, my good fellow,
Eugene’s fate, though, was well disposed...
Even a nonsense, which is droll,
Even few seconds she cannot,
Even few words. Though, she inquired,
Even in absolutely dread...
Even the slander is the same.
Everything casual... the oak floors,
Exactly on the left hand place,
Examined, fixed and cleaned from doze.
Examine her from top to toes;
Excelled and straight into the mud
Exchanged the bows with sitting men,
Excuse for what he’d done he sought;
Expecting to receive bow low;
Expect unconscious sweet caress,
Extended far away its spreads -
Extended to her; she with caution
Extend, then brief and then combine.
Extinguished ash will not make fire,
Falls on the snow. His hazy eyes
“Farewell to peaceable landscape!
Farewell to solitary refuge!
Farewell to you, my odd companion,
Farewell to you, the golden plays!
Farewell to you the joyful nature,
“Farewell to you, the lovely dales

Fears, rumors, lively fairy tales
Feel feared as well and that is why
Feel jealousy and harbor hope,
Feels quite a reasonable fear...
Fell from a horse, since was dead drunk;
Fell silent in the Larins’ home.
Fell victim of the passions plays.

Five hundred years since now), maybe,
Five miles away from Krasnogorie
Flacks of jackdaws and grey-black crows.
Flashed coldly and a victim found,
Flashed on and off, though despite reason
Flashing of speeches, ladies’ dress,
Flied by my youthful day’s extremes.
Flied up the marble steps of staircase
Fluff up the curls and behave gracious,
Follow my muse with less excite.
For all, for all your pleasant gifts!
For an escape, and all for naught.

For country’s fascinating calm,

For fortune telling its prime time.

Forgetting shame claim it wherever
Forget your hope forever, guy!
Forgive me please. Whatever you
Forgive my obscured mind kindly...
Forgive to fever of young years
Forgot of all the other worries.
Forgotten Tanya of passed day,
Forgotten words; and at same time
Forgot the city and his friends,
For handing letters perfect site.
For happy dates a lovely venue;
For heart, for fun, for journal quarrels
For landlords’ property protection!)
For long, and probably for ever.
For long a secret expectation
For long disturbs her thoughts and feels.
For long forgotten evil foes,
For long her flamed imagination
For long he used to fool the world...
For long, like through a misty cloud
For long … No, that was not a dream!
For long you’ve slighted the high life! -
For mature maidens he is superb
For melancholy, lovely torments,
For neighbors, friends and both their dads
For nothing killing time as usual,
For nothing tease your appetite,
For past naive Tatiana’s traces,
For stir, for tempests and for feasts,
For tender verses it’s uncommon,
For the Apollo’s lyre successors,
For the perfidious aggression.
(For this he earns my compliment).
For those, who are worthless and selfish,
For tribute to the fields starts fly.
For vague and obscure bliss you call
For washing shoulders, breast and face...
For whom she pines, who makes her sad,
For winter nature craved, however,
For your poetic meditation?

From all the Larina’s estates
From all these things you should refrain.
From ball to bed he’s moved by carriage.
From beloved Italy exiled
From calaboose to forest greening,
From education we’ve adopted,
From Eneida in his mind
From god forsaken far remote
From here can see and may suggest...
From here Napoleon lost in thoughts
From her so lovely little foot;
From maiden’s room to lobby hallway.
From porch to yard she rushed in scare,
From prince NN. What is the matter?
From private and all other debts,
From prose to verse, from rock to wave?
From Romulo to recent day
From storms escaped now lives in peace
From the infernal library,
From thickets and the backwoods’ cabins..."
(From two to thirty years of old),
From very days of lullaby,
Full of devotion and respect
Full of live verity by stream.
Full of the pans, and jugs, and chairs,
Full speed ahead, ahead my story!
Gallop, mazurka, waltz, they dance.
Gave rise to many silly things,
Gave up for three and point five!
Gave up to summer days impressions,
“Gee up” - the eager cabman cried;
Get angry, drink, get pleased by eating.
Gets in, - a cork with pop springs up,
Gets in... and what a thrill he’s stirring...
Gets inside like a swallow flies.
Gets out fast, to his steed springs
Gets up in p.m., and again
Give kisses, touch the arms and prate,
“Give me the pen and paper, nanny,
Give the advice... it’s time for marriage!...
Glanced at the stage and all around,
Glances around and, then, speaks...
Gnawed by a flip success obtaining,
Goddess inscrutable for mind,
Goddess of mystery and sighing.

Good by, the faded glory’s witness,

Got really mad, when pompous Grim
Got rid of humid cork, and wine

Grow up, enjoy, boil up and swing,
Guillot drew back to a safe site
Gunpowder leaves a greyish track,
Gvozdin - a landlord fair and nice,
Gyaur’s and Juan’s composer, first,
Had brought his soul into amaze.
Had covered her uncheerful face,
Had left a serious impression
Had left with no clarifications.
Had left without hesitations,
Had noticed that Vladimir vanished
Had occupied the world for long.
Had read this sad and grievous letter
Had scribbled here the obscene verses.
Had seized him little at a time.
Had understood it pretty bad
Hark... snow is squeaking ... passerby;
Harold, or Quaker, or Melmoth,
Has arrived stout Triflyakoff,
Has chimed for Lensky by grave sound.
Has decorated knots of trees,
Has disappeared like their light trace.
Has faded at the early dawn,
Has hanged on naked bushes’ branches,
Has hidden entity, when leaving,
Has interfered; and he is mean,
Has killed his fellow at a duel,
Has lived till twenty six years old
Has mixed up morning and midnight
Has resurrected nowadays.
Has run onto the drowned flood lands
Has same boyfriend Monsieur Lepage,
Has she discovered the true word?
Has she interpreted this riddle?
Has turned to the untimely death!
Has vanished with the passing day.
Have caught his suit flap in the nook.
Have come by carriages, by cabs,
Have dropped the eyes, the foes stand still.
Have occupied on stage your place?
Have occupied on stage your place?
Have settled an important deal.
Have you forgotten all your care?
Having escaped from stormy torments
He absolutely did not mind,
He always leaves the best impression,
He answered - Nothing. - And was gone.
He, as before, disclaims the world.
He, being lucky man, maintained,
He brings the dressing gown, and toilet,
He cannot find explanation...
He can not think of other stuff.
He can’t make happy me, that’s why
He ceased to like it in the end -
He cherished hope and was deceived
He comes inside with trepidation;
He could achieve a supreme grade.
He could be bashful, could be gay,
He could be funny, cheer by quarrel,
He could not give a right response.
He covered with taffeta cloth.
He curses women's pranks and tricks,
He danced Mazurka very well
He dashed to chef Talon aware
He’d eat, drink, bore, decay, grow stout,
He demonstrated perfect bearing...
He’d fallen into half a drowse;
He did not hurry, since he thought
He did not move, was mute and pink;
He didn’t forget and did retain.
He didn’t have any inclination
He didn’t like visit local landlords,
He died before the time for lunch,
He’d learn what human life is really,
He’d made me by that pretty glad!
He does not go there and is ready
He does not wit by remarks coldly,
He’d perished at the early dawn,
He drained the bottles, two or three.
He draws an ancient Venus tomb,
He draw the friends to the last step
He’d really got all of a sudden
He dreams of Olga all the time.
He drinks - the same does all the gang,
He drives to her vitreous porch,
He drops the pistol on the ground,
He’d seized him on a table worth
He’d settled in the mansion’s chamber,
“He dwells not far, at Simeon;
He entertained his soul by dreaming
He failed to turn sad thoughts away...
He feels so happy when he’s slipping
He fell in love with forests’ shades,
He felt the trouble overall,
He forwards home to change the cloth.
He frowned, tried to play clavichord,
He gave her lesson in the garden,
He gets as soon as only can.
He gets into the crowded hall,
He gets on, and they start the ride
He gives a sign - gets what asks for,
He gives to servant the directions...
He goes through armchairs, steps on feet,
He had a talent, I can tell,
He had experienced lots of these.
He hardly gives the right response;
He has brought her to exaltation,
He has no chance for duel skipping,
He hasn’t fulfill his dream of glory,
He hold me on his hands sometimes,
He is a master, it is clear,
He is away from fascinations.
He is freemason, that is why
He is just happy, no more odds...
He is not here, no one knows me
He is remembering that time,
He just comes in and is attacked
He knew in Latin a good many...
He learned sometimes the bitter lessons,
He leaves his dwelling place at last,
He leaves his sentimental rhymes,
He leaves pool room, puts cue aside,
He leaves the partners in the end,
He led her to the altar’s throne.
He lies immovable, his brow
He’ll fascinate you, beyond doubt,
He’ll manage all of it, of course.
He’ll shortly leave the naughty world.
He looked ridiculous sometimes.
He looks and sees, that long ago
He looks at her in sweet oblivion
He looks at him and calls... It’s awesome...
He looks like stranger at this place,
(He looks upset and pretty harassed).
He loves you like your kinfolk, yes!
He noticed languid maiden’s burst,
He only rarely dares to try
He passed a doorman in a rush,
He played with me the card game Fool.”
- He promised to be here today,
He pulls a sled like is a horse
Her absent-minded passiveness.
Her blossom, health and vivid feeling,
Her bow was calm and voice was low.
Her breast high raised, the heart beats fast,
Her cheeks and neck like roses flare.
Her confidant and native fellow
Her dad was always nice and straight,
Her darling frisky young companion,
He read by the spiritual eyes
Here, a deep snow pulls of a boot
Here a dictator of the balls
Here a long bough her collar catches,
Here, at the window on this stool,
He recites them in sweet oblivion,
Here Dmitry Larin - slave of God,
Here, he ate coffee and reposed,
Here is a ball, there is a party.
Here is a roast beef’s bloodstained slice,
Here is his letter, word-to-word.
- Here is my elder, Tanya. -“Oh!
Here is my friend, have a good evening!
Here is my hero at the entrance,
Here is my hero, sad and odd.
Here is my novel in verse hero,
“Here is my second - Eugene said. -
Here is the city of white-stones.
Here is this scandalmongers’ minion...
Here - lack of conscious, there - poor style,
He reproved greats of Ancient Greece,
Here’s boredom, there is fraud or lie,
Here’s family of Pygmykoff
Here something making just a puzzle,
Here’s Pradt, and here is Walter Scott.
He returned back and after all
Here was an angry gentleman,
Here was an envoy, who debated
Here was a traveler - by chance
Here was metropolis’s cream,
Here was Prolasov, who had gotten
Here were old ladies in a drowse,
Her eyes are shining blue like sky;
Her eyes now radiate utmost
(Here you expect a rhyme with rose;
Her face didn’t neither blush nor pale...
Her falling down flowing hair,
Her future spouse at that time was
Her head has bent to naked shoulder,
Her head is bowed, the eyes blink courtly,
Her heart by bitter torment flaming
Her heart has sunk, she’s scared to turn.
Her heart is tearing into parts.
Her heart is trembling, she is seeking
Her husband, thus to put away
He rings a bell; here is his servant -
Her languish look by Moon was seized,
Her look is always calm and fair,
Her look is languishing and blessing!
Her love, abandons like a child,
Her Moscow cousin, young princess
Her mourn. She started to keep records,
Her nice in-quarto hands to me,
Her reading fluent eyes are fogging.
Her ringlet bashfully to twist
Herself in Lord knows what surround.
Her smile and modest virgin grace
Her soul by omens was disturbed,
Her soul is moved, her eyes get wet;
Her suitor, whom she didn’t adore,
Her summer walks are getting longer.
Her tender eyes are getting wet.
Her thoughts are roaming far away,
Her view disturbed him more and more.
Her voice in dark just sings, not speaks,
He’s always with her. In her room
He’s at a gathering, and what?
He saw the faces and adornments,
He’s blessed... But, maybe, at that time
He’s brought the orchestra, no kidding!
He’s changed to something, anyway.
He’s deaf and mute, and nothing else.
He searched for them without rapture,
He’s faded! Where’s his excitation,
He’s found her or not, but, yet,
He’s frosted finger, but it’s funny,
He shared with her the youthful plays.
He shed the alive tears in quiet;
He’s honest fellow, that’s for sure”.
He shook the rein - “Gee up, Andryushka!
He should disarm the younger brother,
He should leave home and now must go.
He should nobility uncover
He should not mention there my name! -
He should not say a word, oh, never!
He showed himself in high society
“He’s ignoramus, behaves wildly;
He’s jealous, flushed by indignation,
He’s killed! This dreadful exclamation
He skips and flushing red, then, turns.
He's leaving the cramped public meeting
He sleeps in peace, he’s always meek.
He slides and falls; the first snow flying
He slides with her and whispers something,
He song sad parting and deplored
He song the countries far away,
He song the love to love devoted,
He song the withered being cold
He’s perished. The young poet’s fate
He’s playing billiard with two balls.
He’s same way meek and deaf same way,
He’s shooting with his former friend.
He’s starting pining - still no way.
He’s strict and not at all embarrassed.
He started reading in succession
He starts to frown - they make a brake.
He starts to laugh - and they guffaw,
He starts to play, game over and
He stays alone, his hair is gray.
He stays in bed and does not mind
He stepped aside... and now sideways...
He steps aside, for people calls.
He steps on ice with care, and what?
He stood up, gave a bow to her
He stopped his talent exercising,
He stopped to fall in love with beauties,
He stretched his arm, and she with sorrow
He swears the uninvited guests;
He takes an ice bath after waking,
He thought he’s loved, and in his mind
He thought that Olga would be troubled
He took off dress and with persistence,
He trembles, cannot find words,
He tried in rush with foe to settle,
He tried this time the others' mind
He tried to talk, but could not say
He used sometimes to ridicule
He used to be a witness pleasant
He used to be completely seized.
He used to highlight and denote?
He waked up early in the morning,
He walks in looking like dead pale,
He wandered in the world with lyre
He wants show mercy, he’s obedient,
He was a straight and kind lord,
He was caressed by cunning spouse -
He was ignoring the whole world.
He was not dumb, that’s why Onegin,
He was not Grandison, I bet.
He was not ready to betray
He wasn’t at all a lofty person
He wasn’t at all by that affected,
He was quite close the words to rhyme.
He was seduced by unchecked craving,
He was so much upset by all that
He was the duels doctrinaire
“He was the Poet!” they will say.
He was too young to be depraved
He watched the sun, the clock. And what?
He weaves a bast shoe; sick and frail,
He, who did feel, he is imprisoned
He, who did live and used to reason,
He, whom I sing, is a good mate,
He, who was order’s foe and squander,
He wished to write, but patient labor
He would be glad to cast off chain,
He would leave muses and get married.
He writes response polite and pleasing.
High, lofty, tender, daring, fair?
Himself at conscience secret court,
His albums’ sheets were very well
His ardent heart is captivated
His copious dinner and his wife.
His courage ready to be tortured.
His crackling language's was ist das.
His dad could not that understand,
His everyday routine and studies
His evil courage brought him fame,
His eyes express an evil sentence,
His fame by meanness of his soul,
His father passed away, and shortly
His father served exactly fairly
His flaming soul will shortly find.
His gaze is stubborn, he has truly
His gaze was wonderfully pensive;
His gesture, and leaned on his hand
His glance under the table cast,
His grandpa’s wealth to deuce confide.
His hair was cut in modern fashion,
His head is full of stubborn thoughts;
His heart was close to tear in grieving.
His home and garden, or shall not.
His horse scents snow and looking pleasant
His lazy soul is moved by feeling...
His life in calm and peace was streaming...
His life is scheduled for a day,
His lips compressed, he cannot speak,
His lonely soul immersed in dream
His lyric tongue was pure and bright,
His merits and don’t understand
His mother gestures from away.
His neighbor’s sorrowful gravestone,
His own behavior criticizing
His parents by the filial tears
His pen by adoration smiles;
His pen had grasped nothing at all,
His pipe to call them from away;
His pistol slowly on the walk
His satire plays with triumph staged,
His silenced lyre if not stopped singing
His son just married." - I can see... -
His soul did artlessly display,
His soul is full of indignation!
His soul was warmed up by the care
His sound talk of this of them.
His style to pompous fashion tunes
His uncle planned to pass away.
His uncle wants to say last pardon,
His weary soul has now to endure!
His wound with my Tatiana’s sorrow!
Holding a sock, a gray Calmyk
“How are the neighbors? How’s Tatiana?
“How are you? Fine, then, tell me please,
How at the balls the nobles fun.
How awfully caustic he was!
How can a state exist and why
How can I settle this tough matter?
How can you with your heart and brain
How careless was in private letters!
How could give up himself for love!
How could he innocence withstand,
How could he play this spiteful trick
How could it be, she looked so shy!
How courteous and gratifying!
How did you pay me for my love?
How doleful looks to me appearing
How dull and boring is the way!
How early he could make disquiet
However hard he tries, in vain.
However, love of tender pretties
However much I’d love you now,
How fast and tender were his glances!
“How fast the years do fly away!”
How he, like foolish, cries... it’s me!
How it did thunder in a hall,
How it’s majestic sprinkling jets
- How long ago he was dropped here?
How long ago they used to share
How long he’s here and where’s he from,
How many days and years have passed?
How many feelings you do call!
How nice he was, how hardly trying,
How often in a summer season,
How often in sad separation,
How often on Taurida’s shores
How pleased was I to see it, brothers,
- How poorly you are witting nanny!
How’s frisky Olga spending time?”
How skillful was he to look modern,
How smart I was when telling lies.
How the virgins entertain.
How to escape from debts to find.
How to hold over like a reign
How unexpected were these changes!
How was he languishing tightlipped,
How well complied with the great world!
How well Tatiana played the role
How young was he to be dissembler,
Hurrah, Bordeaux, best friend of mine!
Hussar Pykhtin had stayed at us;
Hussars come here to spend vacations,
Huts, mansions, pharmacies, Cossacks,
Hymned in the verses by Naso,
I
I
I
I
I
I
I
I
I am a figure of high rank.
I am afraid that in my praying
I am appealing to your nous,
Iambus or trochee in the verses
I am deprived of that, and thus,
I am diluting time to time
“I am in love, please, go away”.
“I am in love”, - she whispered faintly
I am in love, yes, nanny” - Oh,
I am not good for any deal...
I am not worth of that, I bet.
I am so old and no more clever.
I am worn out... - "Tell me, nanny
I beg, do terminate my fears.
I beg for mercy and say thanks!
I beg, my newborn creature, move
I beg your pardon, are you ready,
(I bet, for sure, you know that),
I built the plot of my new novel
I by myself belong to those.
I call to you, please come and do,
I call you to oppose the vice.
I can foresee, you’ll be offended
I can lend money to you, ma’am”.
I cannot catch it well, but still
I cannot handle Ai more,
I cannot judge of those because
I cannot leave this in behind,
I can’t betray my heart and thus
I can’t collect in Russian, yet;
I can’t foresee any objection,
I can’t forget him, yes, of course! -
I can’t get and my soul update...
“I can’t imagine worse than find
I can’t just count all of these”.
I can’t select the Russian words).
“I can’t sleep... stifling... nanny, darling!
I can’t withstand it anymore
I’d ask you for a favor, for me
I’d become to him a good fellow,
I’d better still my chatty lyre.
Ideal, folkish, sometimes blissful,
I declaimed my first novel’s rhymes…
Id est, could prove by means of what
I’d formed with tender Muse a union
I’d love the balls till recent day.
I’d love to be my lady fair.
I’d love to watch you every moment,
I’d love to write with no restraints.
I do love her, excuse me please!
I do not blame you... dreadful days...
I do not like the Russian speech
- I do not see here any trouble.
I do not see here any, truly,
I do not want a mocking reader
“I don't hold you, but, to the point,
I do remind you of them!
I ever wished it with such passion
If he could at that time compare
If it would not destroy the manners,
If not, then, Eden you don’t need.
If reading this book you could get,
“If you are in a shortage, then,
If you could know, what a disaster
If you could still remain with me,
If you need something, please, just ask ...
I gave my word. But what’s the matter,
I give my definition here...
I glory here my youthful fellow
I glory him!” Yet, not be healthy
Ignore her before fatal meeting.
I greet the one who’ll recognize
I guessed, perhaps, he’d make a deal.
I happened meet you years ago,
- I hate your high society’s manner
I have attracted your attention
I have enjoyed, and that’s all right;
I have examined written strictly...
I have to go, who can it know?”
I hold you on my hands, sometimes!
I hope the rhymes I’ve left behind

IIs he the same or pacified?
IIt’s winter! And a solemn peasant
I just do need after long speaking
I knew the beauties beyond reaching,
I know that God, who’s always sage,
I know that my age is determined,
I know, that tender Parny’s pen
I know that you till now retain
I know, they try to force the ladies
I live and write not for a praise,
I’ll be bystander sad and cold,
I’ll be bystander sad and cold,
I’ll be compelled, and that’s no doubt,
I’ll be engaged by other demon,
I’ll be Napoleon, no kidding;
I’ll be old-fashioned, yes, I’ll be.
I’ll be so thankful for assistance...
I’ll force them quarrel, after that
I'll now explain it by myself,
“I’ll perish”, Tanya faintly said,
I’ll pray to God, and He will save you! -
I’ll recall speech of tender passion,
“I'll save her from the evil torture,
I’ll show Onegin now again.
I’ll start a poem, then, I guess
I’ll to submissive prose descend;
I’ll transfer all my rights to you.
Illumes this also foolish sky”.
Illuminates her doleful face;
I loved you not by love to brother,
I love so much this English word,
(I love the friendly idle speeches
I love this youthful animation,
I love you, but what is it for?
I love you by a love of brother
I’m changing your enchanting light
I’m close to stop it, let me see.
I’m close to weeping, ululating!..”
I’m fearlessly on it relying…
I’m feeling female’s leg in hands!
I’m free again, want to combine
I’m giddy, nanny, you can see...
I’m giving you this bail intending
I’m glad to note the variations,
I’m loving you to edge of doom;
Immature and now faded years,
I’m not an evil virgins tempter,
Impatient, frivolous and wayward.
Implacable, to love resisting,
Impresses us three thousand years!
Imprison me. Not long ago
I'm shuddering in rage, you see ;
I'm still nostalgic, but no tears,
I’m switching to the elder sister.
I’m tired too. Oh, my poor chest!
I must be sure in the morning
I'm waiting you: so, do, at once,
I’m weeping now... But if you haven’t
In adolescence’s first days
In Africa, my old folk’s place,
In a front room it’s crush and bustle,
In all the guests evoking smile
In a new bed to sleep she fails,
In a nice nook, where my tale’s hero,
In an old robe appeared to meals.
In a sheepskin with red sash tied
In a side street a stead is hiding,
In a torn caftan, wearing glasses,
In a wide hat la Bolivar
In backwoods of forgotten hamlet,
In backwoods, what to do this season?
In bed Tatiana half-live rests.
In blossom of the cheerful hopes
In both the flame in heart had died,
In brackets only I mark out
In bursts of willfulness and passions,
In caps and roses, ill-disposed;
In chorus all the grannies say...
Incomprehensible for brain;
In country wilderness you’re boring,
In dark among the forest’s walls,
In days of revels and sensations
In deaf eternity remote
Indeed, on these sheets you will find
In detail analyze the past,
Indifferent to the new graces,
Indifferent to the new graces,
In dining room on chairs have settled.
In down and in a peaked hat
In drawing room the people crowds,
In dreams, card-reading by the maidens,
In dreams immersed, she walked for long.
In dusk of oakery to follow
In economics was expert,
In epicenter of attention
In epigram it would work, maybe ...)
Inestimable sensual praise,
Inexact accent of the talks
In fireplace the flame was on,
In flash can be enticed away...
Informal family of guests
In former passions recollection,
In forty would fall ill with gout,
In front of faded buildings’ rows
In front of her by glances blazing
In front of hostess light talks flitting
In front of it a lovely scene...
In front of Olga, nice and fair,
In front of slowly burning fires
In front of the affected girl
In front of them I feel so mean,
In front of you I’m shedding tears,
In front of you in thrill to stand,
In frozen bottle for the poet
In general despised all them,
In glasses and fake reddish hair.
In gloomy thoughts her mind rests,
In golden Italy, I know,
In gorgeous style first snow described
In high society’s fatal thrill.
In jest prepares to play her role
In leafy forest’s saving shades
In learning something and somehow
In limpid darkness you flicked up,
In lonely indoors enjoy reading,
In manor-house congregates
In many aspects he would vary,
In meek Moldova’s wilds and forests
In melancholy always staying
In midst of the poetic drowse,
In misty Germany he’d borrowed
In modern fashion, looking fine;
In Moscow many beauties shine.
In mystic gondola we’ll travel.
In native language could not well.
In old traditions routine novel
In other words, twenty four rounds,
In paper cap, exclaimed not once
In pensive lazy mood remains...
In philosophic desert place,
In quilted robe the rest of life
In recollection love affairs
In rooms of Olga and Tatiana
In rush Onegin dresses up
In search for other novel way,
In secret she arranged in banya
In secret Tanya pined of that,
Insensitive to sighs and praises
Inserted boldly oh, belle Tania.
Inside and out of the theatre
In silence all the day and night.
In silence complementing, though
In silence flapping with the oars;
In silence you conversed with me,
In single image were combined
In sleigh by Neva’s bank he drives
In solitude of rural space!
Inspected field works on weekdays,
Inspired gaze and mind’s style,
Inspiring hopes of local mums.
Inspiring moon illumed the scene.
Inspiring words so nice and blissful
In spring, on Orphic mystic meadows,
In spring, when stepping on greensward,
Instead of bristling up like beast;
Instead of feast, instead of gift
Instead of forests we get shadows.
In stir of stormy reckless thoughts,
In style as smart antiquity.
In such a boredom kill your time?”
Insulted you over a bottle
In sweet oblivion is resting,
Intended Olga he for me,
Intended reading cards at night,
Intend to play or to make fun,
Interpret Say and Bentham essays,
Interpret what is worth of thee,
In the beginning of my tale
In the beyond of civil world
In the dark glass, and nothing else.
In the dark shades of leafy room.
In the dead silence being drawn.
In the estate above a river,
In the estate, and why should not?”
In the high life, how to be formal,
In the high life’s stir and in calm
In the Moldova’s steppes he died.
In the old cap and camisole.
In the old days you showed compassion,
In the past century delayed;
In the snowdrifts on Tanya’s way
In the twilight of candles’ shine.
In thirty matched like found gold;
Into a sweet and sinless stream.
Into his cloak, like dreadful treasure,
Into the poetry’s expressions.
In useless boring they are dying.
In vain are all your priceless treasures,
In vain in diverse entertainments
In vain some time ago Napoleon
Invents for fun according fashion,
Invisible, you were my dear,
Invited them to clarify...
Invites her to cotillion dance.
Invites to visit him tonight.
Involuntary or good willed.
Inwardly drew the guests cartoon.
In well-arranged seductive net.
In wilderness, in charming calm,
In wilderness, where Eugene only
In windows shadows are produced
In winter time, here, he shared table
In winter time, when ballerina
In winter, when the days are thin,
In yellow shawl or ladies’ hat!
I offer my congratulation
I place Tatiana’s vivid feels.
I planned like Alban to explain
I plead to poets... were not really
I pulled your ears for childish pranks!
I read it with a mystic sorrow,
I read not much and sleep for long
I read to nanny in seclusion,
I recognize its worthless essence
I retain how you were baptized!”
Irregular and careless babble,
Is always by false shame excited.
Is always frowning, taciturn,
I saw the other whimsy ladies,
I saw the sea before storm coming...
I say to my Onegin bye.
I say without lyric tinsel...
Is close to lifeless, there’s no wreath;
Is coming out in light clothing,
Is craving homage, and has found
Is creeping sliding off the gate.
Is engaged by Tambov’s Trike,
Is first to drink to Tanya’s health
Is flying to the blooming grounds.
Is full of guests... the friends and neighbors
I shall depict in passion’s storm,
I shall in detail introduce.
I shall rehearse you being stern
I shall request for your excuse...
I shall retell the casual speeches
I shall start now, though all above
Is he all right, or something wrong?”
I shed the tears, was scared and feared,
Is he just odd and harmful person,
I should be better than am now;
I should be wise, I should be clever,
I should new character conceive...
I should not know of you and thus,
I should not know the bitter torment.
I shouldn’t digressions exercise.
I shouldn’t murmur, why should I?”
I should prefer against the passions,
Is insupportable, I bet.
Is it because at high life’s routs
Is just an implement, and thus,
Is just the same for many years.
Is killed by friendly hand, for sure!
Is laying pathway on a sleigh.
Is lying by a baby talk.
Is making hiss; Trike can’t stop
Is meeting them. They hear a squeak
Is much attractive in my eyes.
Is Neva’s famous Cleopatra,
Is not more cared, the former path
Isn’t he from backwoods so well known?
“Isn’t she in love?” - Who can it be?
Is paralyzed by lazy mood.
I spent in idleness in shades.
Is proud of his style of life,
Is safer than of friends and kin...
Is she a baby or coquette?
Is she that girl ... or it’s a dream?
Is she that one Tatiana, really,
Is skating on the ice with noise;
Is slowly trotting in some way.
Is snoring heavy Triflyakoff
Is still of interest to those,
Is there a wilderness or desert,
Is this delight to me uncommon,
Istomina stands in a crowd
I stroll and nobody can find
I stroll by a deserted lake
I stroll by sea shore weather minding
Is twinkling, spinning by the whirls,
Is used to go somewhere for gambling.
Is vague and obscure; where, what for
Is vulgar (Can’t find other term...
Is watching her across the hall.
Is widely used in letters’ speech.
Is worth of overmature apes,
(It also happened in past years,
It always boils, but is useless.
It breathed and howled and here it is,
“It cannot be, - reflects Onegin, -
It comforts and the sorrow treats.
It’d covered all the countryside,
It’d happened that another landlord
It did not make the neighbors glad,
It disturbs stomach. Oh, my dear...
It does attract by pleasant form
- It does not matter, turn your head...
It entertains the adolescents,
It grabs her quickly and speeds on;
It happened, he got trapped as well,
It happened in the late time evenings
It happened that an early breeze
It happened that instead of ink
It happened that the nobles willing...”
It happens, he recites to Olya
It happens, though, some noble ladies
I think all that is in my dreams...
- I think it was what God was telling.
I think today it is my turn.
- I think, we shall, - Vladimir said.
I thought that liberty and quiet
It irritates and makes me angry;
It is a countrymen’s convention...
It is a divine will: I’m yours;
It is a kin of Russian rite,
It is an album, where, my friends,
It is a place for ploughmen’s rest,
It is a place where beaus show fashions,
It is a place, where nightingale
It is consumption, people saying.
It is enough with him to travel
“It is Eugene!” And light like shadow,
It is excusable. Eugene,
It is for others a good lesson,
It is monotonous and bright,
It is more tender than of pipe...
It is quite new in Russian world
It is the same, the passing time
It is unbearable, I say,
It is unbearable to find
It is what she is looking on.
It is your lunchtime, don’t forget.
It languished her like troubling dream;
It’ll stop without my assistance.
It looked like he was really moved,
It looks like novel’s scene, you know ...”
It looks like someone’s hand compression
It made him resolute and bold,
It made me proud to amaze
It makes a sacred thing to me,
It makes no difficulty now.
It makes you sad, calms down feelings.
It opens squeaky entrance door
It presages to covert gaze
It promises; because of that
It purrs and washes snout by leg...
It rouses in my soul and blood!
It runs and bubbles making steam.
It’s always causes great anxiety
It’s bursts are worth of highest praises,
It’s by the heaven’s council settled…
It’s calm; under a downy pillow
It’s come and scattered, with white bunches
It's cram, excitement and ardor,
It’s dinner time for country sage!
It’s doing that and does not cease.
It seems to me, when being younger,
It serves me right, he thought when judging
It’s fearful! To avoid the thrill
It’s getting dark, he went sleigh riding,
It’s getting dark; on table shining
It’s getting dark. The sky stopped shining.
It’s hidden in the obscure haze.
It’s Hymen’s bonds and monotone,
Its idle purpose makes no sense.
It’s like a mass of snow and ice
It’s mine! announced Eugene sternly,
It’s nice, my friend, when you can see
It’s nice to check the time of day,
It's nice to rage embarrassed foe
It’s nice to see that he doesn’t more
It's noble..." Here I could, for sure,
It’s not the best age I do guess.
It’s not the thing I’m searching for,
(It somehow English spleen reminds
It’s on the table quickly placed.
“It’s over six and time to go,
It sparkles like a sacred spring
It speeds; now on a forest way
It spins and shines, the day starts glow.
It’s proud of the Russian folks...
It’s quite correct... at that right time
It’s sad to think that just for nothing
It’s sonorous and nice, no doubt,
It stiffens, ossifies; nobody
It’s time for all of us to rest.
It’s time for you, the idle creatures,
It’s time, it’s time! - I want be free!
It’s time of warmth, of works, of sighs,
It’s time to change my tale direction
It’s time to change the robe and hat.
It’s time to finish it, so far!
It’s time to leave the boring land,
It’s time to match the elder one,
It stirred my heart for so long mute,
It stirs emotions in the heart,
It stirs her heart, she’s pleased by that.
It stirs up blood in withered heart,
It's to the lady of the house
It’s what my soul does not accept;
It’s what we scarcely would confess.
It’s where I also used to play,
It’s where my cherished dream extends...
It’s youthful trouble - love (I guess)!
It trapped him, in dark corner placed.
It warmed up tea in pot from China
It was a country migrant merchant,
It was a noble, even pleasant
It was, as well, the old lord’s nook.
(It was a valuable bail!)
It was a year, when autumn weather
It was by parents sanctified.
It was hanged up on a pine tree
It was in Lycee’s lovely alleys,
It was right place for declarations,
It was so noble to surrender...
It was the tender feels inciting
It was unusual strange collection.
It was what a young rake expected,
I used to feed you with the cakes!
I used to know the tales of old times,
I used to play with his war prize -
I used to spend my last one lepton

I value hours, - alas,
Ivan Petrovich - greedy man,
I’ve honored classicism, and thus,
I’ve killed a lot of my life way!
I’ve learned the voice of new desires,
I’ve read what you have pleaded for...
I want to be sincere and honest.
I was aggressive, he was quiet.
I was astonished, I was burning,
I was conceived for peaceful being,
I was thirteen years old, you see,
I wish to cast at you my glance!
I wish you’d burned by thunder bang!
I wondered at their haughty pride,
I wonder what she’s dreaming of.
I won’t amend these or correct.
I won't believe, but is at last
I won’t believe, but is it real,
I won’t give up my heart’s adores!
I won’t let flower to wane,
I won’t let terrible debaucher
I won’t let toxic worm to gnaw
I won’t tell you today, my friend,
I would be happy... as could be!
I write and please by that my heart,
I write these lines one reason for,
I write to you, - what can be further?

Just after leaving morning drowse
Just airs and graces, nothing else,
Just being charmed by friendly care,
Just chain of meals in front of you,

Just getting rid of swaddling clothes.
Just hearing an approaching coach,
Just here, the Kremlin’s key awaited

Like by a down covered lightly.

Like ruddy cherub at Palm week
Like sapling changes leaves not once,
Like shadow or a faithful wife.

Like staying always in his hut

Like with no smile the pretty lips,

Look at her shoulders and her breast,
Look at her silently and coldly,
Look at the life as at a queue
Looked like not being of their own.
Looking light-hearted, nice and sweet
Look pretty lovely, my good guys!

Looks like a quiet, easy body,
Looks like offense, or fun, or lies,
Looks very languishing and weird.

Of her young plays, and moved by that
Of hopes and pranks and pleasant dreams.
Of love, of Olga, all the same!
Of lyre’s creative tongue and charm.
Of many peasants, forests, lands,
Of my youth’s stormy boiling days
Of naked birches, ashes, aspens.
Of nymphs, who make a nice background.
Of obscure cordial old times,
Of people’s tears and clapping splashes
Of perished in the autumn leaves
Of pretty girls and well known dames.
Of rain, of yard, of flax, of wax...”
Of Richardson and J. Russo.
Of right appointment with thee;
Of right to kiss her senseless hand...
Of rivers, factories and plants,
Of sacred spring, the time for love!
Of senseless song, just little breezy.
Of starting day, which looked so bright.
Of the admirers on behind.
Of the cold mind’s observations
Of their and other’s amour conquests,
Of the neat items Europe made.
Of the seductive springtime nights,
Of twenty songs at least, not less.
Of what he’s planning for tomorrow,
Of what no one distrusts long since,
Of where I suffered, where I loved,
Of whom a hundred years they talk...
Of whom a poet sighs and pines,
(Of whom I told in the beginning),
Of wine has not yet bottomed up,
Of wise and reasonable calm,
Oh, Brenta, Adriatic spaces,
Oh! Can it happen? Yes, may be!
Oh, God, have mercy upon us!
Oh, God, save me, what could he think!”
Oh, how could I forget, Goddamn!
Oh! How for long disturbed my mind
Oh, is there somewhere such a being
Oh, legs, enough to dream of you!
Oh, Moscow, what a great affection
Oh, Moscow, you disturbed my heart!
Oh, my dear friends, is all in vain?
- Oh, my old man, I am in doubt. -
Oh, people, you are all the same,
Oh, Vladimir! In the beyond,
Oh, Vladimir! Not for long time
Oh, what an early bird, my dear!
“Oh, yes, that’s perfect, that’s good deal,
Oh, you, an honorable spouse!
Olga’s admirer came to them,
Olga’s sweet image; it’s, indeed
On a capacious sunny meadow,
On almanac’s by time worn pages
On an unsteady shaky bed,
On a park bench obtained escape.
On a snowed road a boy is running.
One and the same and well known sorrow,
One and the same familiar feeling,
One day, when visiting his aunty,
One dream will change the other ones,
Onegin bored, and then decided,
Onegin came to window and
Onegin comes to Olga, then
Onegin did not like much reading,
Onegin didn’t like all of that.
Onegin didn’t postpone the matter
Onegin drives to boulevard,
Onegin dropped at Tanya’s feet.
Onegin follows after him;
Onegin gently brings Tatiana
Onegin had more just perception;
Onegin hated litigation
Onegin heard with a stern face
Onegin is among them sitting
Onegin is morbidly paling -
Onegin left for home, of course.
Onegin lived like real hermit,
Onegin looks inept and gloomy,
Onegin met him, and not once
Onegin now is getting off,
Onegin opened one cupboard -
Onegin, patient and indulgent,
Onegin pushes off the stuff.
Onegin raised his hand with moan,
Onegin searched in great impatience
Onegin shortly was aware
Onegin shot... The clock of fate
Onegin should not wait for long”.
Onegin’s letter to Tatiana
Onegin’s mind and his feel.
Onegin speeded after all.
Onegin speeded to the theatre,
Onegin’s sudden apparition,
Onegin stands like specter shading.
Onegin stayed upset and shocked.
Onegin stood immersed in dreaming
Onegin them as well declined,
Onegin, then, came close to her
Onegin usually conveyed
Onegin waits... here’s Lensky driving,
Onegin was as always silent;
Onegin was besides that pictured.
Onegin was by boredom chased
Onegin was by view of many
Onegin was prepared with me
Onegin was quite fair and nice
Onegin was the first to raise
Onegin was vividly stirred,
Onegin with no extra motions,
One more thing separated us:
One of her feet touches the floor,
One with the horns and doggy muzzle,
On fading brow you see the death,
On inflamed tongue pink sticker dries,
Only Eugene is in her thought,
Only in January it snowed.
Only the family, I bet.
On many read by Tanya pages
On melting snow he’s quietly dreaming
On northern doleful snowy carpet
On Saturday. My dear and mom
On slippery and icy ground;
On the Caucasian winding trails
On the dull stage the well-known faces,
On the dull stage the well-known faces,
On vernal flowers they step?
On walls of huts made of the logs
On which the modern world is spinning!
On your like poppy burning face”.
Open the window, sit with me”.
Opinion of a husband, then,
Or a fast hare crossing a road
Or any other bagatelle
Or a repose of your hard job,
Or being by a nuisance throttled
Or being sank into oblivion
Or breast stirred up by love expression.
Or cunning tempter sent by devil:
Or didn’t grieve much and stopped to pine?
Or dismal glance will fail to find
Or dismal glance will fail to find
Or else, and here without jesting,
Or epigram the garbage worth,
Or even Demon, whom I fame.
Or even turned to be a poet.
Or flaming roses of the cheeks,
Or flying by it will pass me?
Or, gently, like a morning moth,
Or he is now just decent fellow,
Or Idol mio, and same time
Or is still posing as oddball?
Or it is fruitless and in vain
Or just the virgin soul’s frustration!
Or maiden’s letters worth of praise.
Or mail them postcards otherwise
Or manages her way to track,
Or marked by Baratynsky’s pen,
Or, maybe, in the mind dreaming,
Or Melmoth by the phantoms tortured,
Or other literature figure
Or Scott, or Byron or Seneca,
Or since she loves with no dissembling
Or so mysterious Sbogar.
Or tell the news or fashion trends.
Or terminate the gloomy silence
Or the long dress’s trim to kiss.
Or to her gestures can respond.
Or, what can be? ... Oh, God forbid!
Or when departing at the steps
Or where you used to shine and revel.
Or with the nature animation
Or with the years would just get dim.
Over the lexicon not once.
“Pachette!” - Alina, dear Princess! -
Paris of all the local place,
Passes poor cabins, gardens, stores,
Paterfamilias (single), then,
Patrols the remote heavens’ dome;
Pensiveness was her best girlfriend
Perceiving in the noise and quiet
Perceiving it as separation;
Perfectly durable and tranquil,
Performing by the shy school girls
Perfume in stylish cut-glass bottle
Perhaps sometimes on Neva’s banks
Persuade, dissuade, and then surrender
Philosophy by Fontenelle,
Pine forest, shadow, tempest, gale,
Pipes’ amber from Constantinople,
Placed on the table china cups;
Please, be my guard, whom I do trust,
Please, bless the job I do long time,
Please come to me and share my life!..”
Please, do not worry, in a day
Please, don’t be angry with me Tanya,
Please, earn the tributes of the glory...
Please, follow me, give me a favor,
Please, heed my voice and sad request...
Please, heed my voice and sad request...
Please leave the city’s restless site,
Please, listen to me and be wise,
Please listen to me with no temper...
(Please, note the chapter number one)
- Please, pour me half a glass more, brother...
Please, send your grandson with this note. -
Please, settle my heart hesitation.
Please, stay in piece under the stone!”
Plus two-three other novels, most
Poetic dreams will leave my brain,
Poetic Muse to me arrived.
Point-blank refuse. She always greaves,
Poisoned by jealousy and stern!
Politely, like a chilly pedant,
Political and state affairs;
Pomp Moscow shows the same approach.
Poor girl doesn’t hear the two friends’ greeting;
Poor Lensky tragically perished.
Poor Tanya could not withstand these.
“Poor Yorick - dolefully he said, -
Poured by the Olga’s hand was filling
Pour on like rain and never cease.
Pour out light and cheer the minds,
Pour out secrets, prays, appeals,
Preferred to teach him just in jest
Preparing perish to each other.
Presentiments constrained her chest.
Present me to her”. - Are you kidding?
Presents the elegies’ rich row,
Present their insolence and vests,
Present to you (that makes me thrill)
Prince brings Onegin close to her,
Princess is single in the mansion.
Princess that sits in front of him,
Proceeds ahead and what is that?
Produced in Eugene bad vibration.
Produces languishing and boredom?
Promised far trip and cavalier.
Promises to her something obscure.
Promoting splendid life impression
Pronounce common banal phrase
Proudly challenged you to fight?
Provide a shaky baleful cross;
Provoked the silenced feels resembling;
Provoked the tears, brought consolation...
Purpose of ode makes high expense,
Puts on a sleigh the frozen corps.
Put vale in the letters end.
Qu' ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;
Ragtag and bobtail, that’s nightmare...”
Ran to Anisiya with intention
Read in oblivion time to time
Reanimate the heart reliance
Recalling the great Petrarch’s lyre,
Recites poor madrigal, shows charm,
Regards, congratulations, speeches,
Regret, deep sorrow, indignation
Regret for past and for bygone;
Regrets for an unworthy husband
Reiterate one and same croak,
Rejecting nothing; besides that,
Relinquished stormy delectations,
Relying mostly on a debt,
Remain and stir imagination,
Remained quite happy. Blessed is that,
Remains in vaunted grandpas’ age...
Remember, what did say satirist!
Reminded flighty Venus feast,
Remind me my roots and folks.
Remind me the vernal floods...
Repentance brings his soul to thrill,
Replaced to me the law and rules,
Replaces Breguet watch by stomach;
Replace this trash and masquerade,
Replies to your hopeless request,
Reproved for pranks by gentle talk
Rereading letter can not end.
Respecting them as boring medley?
Respect to his exaggerations,
Restrains with lapse of time, at last,
Retained in common people’s rite,
Reveillez-vous, belle endormie.
Reveres the dreamy love, that’s why
Revive and ripen in rain’s passions;
Revive Corneille’s dramatic story,
Reward the singer. Tanya can’t
Rhapsodic manor of the talk,
Riding a steed to bridle obedient,
Right at this minute so much evil
Right here, orthography defying,
Right on the fur coats are in drowse.
Rises her up, calls to a window.
Romantic eloquent madcap.
Romantic noble aspiration,
Romantic pal and pensive dreamer
Romantic roses glorifying
Ruffianoff, Gvozdin, Rusteroff
Ruffianoff speeds by Triflyakova.
Ruffianoff, who’s my ardent brother,
Ruffianov wooed - reject, alas.
Russo (to mention passing that)
Rusteroff, Olga calls to dance,
Sad premonitions does preset,
Said briefly that he’s always ready.
Sat at a window and crushed flies.
Saw poor Tatiana’s perturbation,
Scapegraces‘ head, tribune of taverns,
Search for a daughter a good mate.
Seclusion, loneliness and quiet,
Sed alia tempora! Thus, boldness
Seductive talent exercise
Seeds cabbage like Horace in Greece,
Seeing my portrait, reading name
Semen Petrovich - fool, as well,
Semi-amusing, semi-wistful,
Sends you take custody of me…
Severely judged and criticized.
Shall fall into the beyond stay.
Shall put on them a wedding wreath...
Share public’s passions and its thoughts.
She animated in her dreams
She at the table took a sit
She beat her maids for the omissions
She bemoaned over you, alas!
She bloomed like lily of the valley,
She broke the obscured mind’s bonds.
She by her blood the albums signed,
She came to the departing cab
She cannot get relief and, thus,
She can see neither wood, nor meadow.
She can’t learn an escape for soul.
She could not stand and wept for long.
She couldn’t this awful dream forget.
She crossed the stream and went ahead,
She dared to leave the hiding site,
She dare not seal it with carved stamp.
She did not move a muscle, even
She did not notice them before,
She did not show just any fever,
She didn’t enjoy the loud noise,
She didn’t know what to do in scare;
She didn’t object, tears in the eyes,
She’d learned a hold to get it over
She does not greet the winter more,
She does not listen to the guests
She does not notice all his troubles,
She does not notice coming morning,
She does not raise him up, besides,
She does not say... I’d better wait,
She does not see, or does not care,
She does not sleep, her face turns pale.
She dreams she is a heroine
She dropped ... “He’s here, Onegin!
She drops a handkerchief; to waste
She enters the abandoned place.
She escapes to the park to mourn,
She fails to find anything
She falls on snow; the bear doesn’t wait,
She feels indifferent to rhyme?
She feels quite happy, she is fine.
She feels unwell, her breast high raised.
She felt unreasoned hesitation,
She flashed across and at the lake
She flied to him in virgin’s dreams,
She flied, to turn back did not dare.
She followed them by doleful gaze...
She gets up with a morning rise
She glanced at him. “What’s going on?”
She glorified my hearth and home
She had discovered a new world.
She had forgotten bliss and brilliance
She had forsaken in past times,
She had retained her look and tone,
She had unveiled a secret measure
She hands a book in French and sighs.
She has forgotten noisy ball,
She hates to leave the native place.
She hears the strangers’ cries and noise.
She hurries to communicate.
She in oblivion tells by heart
She is afraid a breath to take,
She is a friend of my young days,
She is alone, no one around!
She is alone with moon and stars.
She is approaching looking stern
She is awaiting with impatience,
She is disturbed by her night dreaming.
She is disturbed, her soul is troubled
She is in fever, she’s amazed,
She is in panic, close to fainting
She is just blooming! Someday let’s
She is returning home by walking,
- She is the one who’s looking sad,
She led me in the dusk of night
She liked the novels since her young,
She’ll chat and hush then for a while.
She looked at it, the unknown place
She looks around - all is fine.
She looks around holding breathing,
She looks around, in a parlor
She looks at all this fancy chick,
She looks at the deserted garden
She looks aware. A simple maiden,
She looks so calm, she is not sick!
She loved to greet the coming dawning,
She must detest him being clever
She mustn't miss him; but, same time...
She named Praskov’ya Paulin,
She never knew how to make lace,
She peeps through chink, and what she sees?
She promptly quickens hasty gait,
She ran around in a moment
She rent her hair and wept, at first,
She’s always modest and obedient,
She’s at the window, and Diana
She saw a mansion from a knoll,
She’s close to fall into a faint.
She’s come to senses, looks and sees...
She’s dreaming that she’s quite alone,
She’s given to reflection, shy,
She shivers with the cheeks aglow,
She should depart from Eugene’s world.
She shyly stands under a crown,
She sighs and to herself assigning
She’s in confusion... “Shall I see
She's keeping silent all the time.
She’s leaning against hand by cheek.
She’s left. Onegin stays upset,
She’s like Madonna by Van-Dyke,
She’s looking at an obscure space.
She slowly rides by open fields.
She’s not loquacious and not cold,
She’s pale and worries, what’s the matter,
She’s pale, extinct and always quiet!
She’s peeping through the door ajar...
She’s pleased by oligarchic manners
She sprang from porch the guest to greet
She’s reading epitaph, at that
She’s running, but it chases her,
She’s scared to look behind and
She’s simple but a nice babushka.
She’s singing, friend of winter nights -
She’s sliding through a shining crowd
She’s suffocating, heavy breathing;
She’s suffocating... in her dreams
She started shivering and paling.
She startled slightly, staying mute
She still receives him at her house,
She stops at it and puzzled tries
She stops for long and holds her look.
She stops the horse by the reins drawing.
She streams back home to woods and fields,
She suddenly jumps and is in flight,
She’s watching in a sweet distress
She’s worth of this amazing morning,
She thinks... “What is now Olga doing?
She turns one page after another,
She used to bring her magic gifts,
She used to visit nomads’ dwellings,
She walked and walked, all of a sudden
She wants to know what does it sign,
She was afraid, and to her cry
She was again in the same dome,
She was awaiting... and he came.
She was awaiting something bad.
She was entirely fatigued,
She was my neighbor”. - Then, let’s go. -
She wasn’t involved, but loved the tales,
She was that one who had inspired
She was with Richardson in love.
She will not see him never-ever,
She wished her life with him to share,
She with her husband didn’t divorce.
She woke up at a usual time
She wore the corsets fitted tight
Should always be respected, right?
Should attempt writing after me”.
Should at that time his person show
Should I by family nice picture
Should I fall down punched with arrow,
Should I see you again sometimes?..”
“Should I want to confine my being
Shouldn’t they try peace way to discover?
Showed pride and drew up best of all.
Showing the ill-disposed disgrace.
Shows that this forecast is correct,
Siberian severe frost!
Sick auntie’s cuddles and enjoyment
Side streets extending to the dark,
Since all my life was just a pledge
Since all that time he was afraid
Since does not hear the fans’ applauds,
Since early morning Larin’s manor
Since for the first time introduce
Since got the news from far away...
Since hears behind the bear’s breathing;
Since he was yawning when he strolled
Since I am not a sinner more.
Since in that age (you can't deny it)
Since loved to touch the carpets that
Since morning dressed awaits for that.
Since not for long he could and would
Since only poet’s soul still prays
Since people are the customs’ slaves.
Since people need to have repose;
Since poets by their Muse inspired
Sincere cordial confession,
Since scarcely in the Russian lands
Since she is trustful and from Heaven
Since shooting ace from gun he lightly
Since that complies with people’s rites,
Since that time, when Tatiana’s image
Since they of primitive remind
Since to Eugene she gave her word.
Since, when surfeited with delighting,
Since young enkindled his soul flaming.
Sings songs of love in a calm dale.
Sit down, darling, it’s so odd!
Sits on a scraggy shaggy weed.
Sleeps dreaming blissfully in quiet.
Slender and long like waist of thee...
Smile of your lips, of the eyes movement
So accidentally was ravished.
So far as for his pleasant wife,
So far as for the friend of mine,
So far as I can understand,
So far, do revel your existence
So lively, cheerful and carefree,
So many, many days have passed
Someday they’ll get the magic brands
Some native books he also read
Some of them even clarified
Some of them really got mad,
Someone hysterically cried.
Someone, who looks like wistful jester,
Some poetaster from armed forces
Something unclear did suggest,
Sometimes, a knoll or a small brook
Sometimes an unsuspected meeting
Sometimes aroused the hopeful thoughts,
Sometimes a youthful guy he’s seeing,
Sometimes, before the coming evening
Sometimes, he used in bed still staying,
Sometimes I’ll finish my true tale
Sometimes I was not too much wary...
Sometimes on Sundays, wearing glasses,
Sometimes she greets him by a bow,
Sometimes, the common sense could follow,
Sometimes will finish it, I guess.
Some years ago in high society
So much confused and so fatigued
So much, so many Fate erased!
So strict in judgment and exact,
So switching business time and leisure
Souls’ inspirations and delights.
So, what? - “All right”. - You are so nice! -
“So, you are married! I can see!
Speeds at full tilt in a great fear;
Spill with Champaign straight from a bottle,
Spread by the river uncared garden.
Spread over my poor nanny’s grave...
Spring resurrection causes thrilling
Sprout out, mature and fade down
Sprouts out in a sunlight boil.
Squeezes her heart and does remind
Squints at the ladies in box seat;
Stands mute and vague in live surround,
Stands up adopting pompous bearing,
Starts her way back in the moonlight.
Starts singing falsely. Splashes, screaming
Starts to perceive, thanks God for that,
Starts with Onegin recollecting
Staying alone the day and night;
Stays in the stylish cell for long.
Steel files for nails and combs for hair,
Stepped over the Beyond threshold
Steps on the stage, on parquet floor,
Still feel deep sorrow... But should they?
Still jump all over and make noise.
Still thinks of him. The page’s turned over,
Stirred by a bliss and by a grief
Stirred in Eugene just no reactions,
Stirred up her soul, her heart beat fast.
Stood like a picture at the doors,
St. Petersburg does never sleep,
Strains all her hearing just to know
Streams in the glasses clinking cool.
Street lampions, long skirts and boys,
Stroke up close friendship just forever.
Stroll every morning holding hands.
Success is not her major gain,
Such rambling, banal dialogs.
Suffused with consecrated dream
Suffused with laziness and passions,
Suspecting in it a great harm
Swung a strange wreath above the urn;
Tabernacles of the barbarians,
Takes a full hour or more.
Talk over her between each other
Tatiana ah! What a night mare!
Tatiana asked; the helpful boys
Tatiana at her place remained.
Tatiana at the window standing
Tatiana blushed, began to tremble.
Tatiana burns in feeling’s flame,
Tatiana by a curious look
Tatiana casts a glance at him...
Tatiana charmed and fascinated
Tatiana, charming girl Tatiana!
Tatiana, dear, come closer, please,
Tatiana didn’t take dolls on hands
Tatiana doesn’t care, not at all.
“Tatiana!” - Do you know her? - “Yes,
Tatiana enters empty home,
Tatiana feels like a half dead;
Tatiana felt unreasoned shame
Tatiana heard with some vexation
Tatiana hearing this idea
Tatiana hopped to a back stairway,
Tatiana in a brief contents
Tatiana in confusion hurried
Tatiana in the dark doesn’t sleep,
Tatiana is in trepidation,
Tatiana is unnoticed sitting
Tatiana listened to his preach;
Tatiana listens to their voice,
Tatiana lived - a naive dreamer.
Tatiana looks at outdoor
Tatiana looks quite free and fine.
Tatiana manifests in earnest
Tatiana murmurs at the spring
Tatiana ohhs, and ahhs and sighs,
Tatiana on advice of nanny
Tatiana (purely Russian creature,
Tatiana reads the books and finds
Tatiana’s heart he really stirred.
Tatiana shortly left for home.
Tatiana’s husband enters. Here
Tatiana’s January name-day!
Tatiana’s letter I look over,
Tatiana’s letter to Onegin
Tatiana’s letter to translate.
Tatiana’s nanny was aware,
Tatiana’s soul flew far away,
Tatiana’s thanks for all of that...
Tatiana still is calm and steady
Tatiana to the forest dashes;
Tatiana to the yard from home
Tatiana tries to analyze
Tatiana trusted in the legends
Tatiana views all that with pleasure,
Tatiana wakened in the morning
Tatiana was her sister’s name...
Tatiana will be represented
Teaches to kids the alphabet.
Thank you for pleasure and enjoyments,
Than let someone his name defaming,
Than Moon prevailing in the sky.
That all the best expected deeds
That all the rubbish I write now
That a self-portrait I did write,
That big wigs value absurd features,
That - by repentance occupied,
That can resolve her hesitation.
That carelessness of ardent natures
That could not make a better deal.
That darkness obscures bright day glow.
That despite all his witty wise
That foolishness a harm conceives,
That friendship with him did not mind...
That friends would prefer shackles bearing
That he is awfully unusual.
That he’s Tatiana’s fiance.
That he was very nice and sane.
That in my rhymes you often meet
That in two weeks he’ll earn the treasure -
That is a subject best of all!
That is, by what divine Homer
That is Onegin’s sacred living.
That is the master’s room and board,
That is the same for many years.
That it is not too smart to stop
That it’ll be sad not recognized
That Lensky sent Onegin challenge,
That looks like fence while speedy run.
That make me feeling sick and poor.
That marriage settlement was made,
That my, besides all that, poor style
That pity in his soul conceived...
That resurrected her at last...
That’s by the heaven predestined.
That scoffed at sisters’ monogram,
That separated us for years.
That shall see you again by day…
That she, how we from London learn,
That should repay their declaration
That’s how a butterfly is shining
That’s how a hare in field is trying
That’s how he had killed eight young years,
That’s how he wrote, inertly, gloomy,
That’s how in dream we streamed away
That’s how Onegin moralized.
That’s how the century does mend!
That’s how the country fuss without
That’s how Yazykov instigated
That’s it! I’m scared to read again…
“That’s it, now go”. And in cold mind
That spring of my galloping days
That started to behave like mad,
- That’s that. He’s killed. - Someone does say.
“That’s that, he’s killed”, - the neighbor said.
That still imprisoned his young mind.
That’s true, of course. But whirl of fashion,
That sucks the flower’s sap off;
That’s what exactly thought Onegin.
That’s what I love to see and learn.
That’s what she asked the guest at first.
That’s what she tries to clarify.
That’s what the heart of virgin sought.
That’s what the nature has established
That’s where Didlo was crowned with glory.
That the arch person will somehow
That there are chosen by the fortune
That they were just a hollow toy.
That was inscribed from top around
(That was the locals’ smart invention
That was the thing that racked his brains,
That you’ve betrayed the youth and something
The adjuration will remind...
The admiration sense by brain,
The alley to the lake and there
The almanacs and magazines,
The altar’s sacred flame has gone!
The always lofty noble feelings,
The ancestors to coffins bring.
The anthem of the future tribes
The anthem, which the Lord does praise.
The ardent poet’s self-expression;
The arrogance of haughty creatures,
The art the poet suffered for,
The atmosphere is languid, pale,
The aunties noticed this straight glance
The autumn storm destroys and rends,
The awful bear groans, falls the trees,
The ball is shining in the best.
The balls to me made great delight,
The basins, pots, and all that stuff,
The bear announced... stay with those,
The bear behind, she’s in fear;
The Beastoffs couple, gray and sage,
The beasts are sitting at the table;
The beauties drew no more attention
The beauties in light gowns attired,
The beauties’ novel generation
The beaver collar in the night.
The Being revel and full cup
The belfries, churches, booths and mansions
The biting frost the nature froze,
The blood from smoking wound does bleed.
The blood runs cold, when I remember
The bony fingers, bloody tongs,
The books by Gibbon and Russo,
The boredom of unmarried life
The boring pictures only sight
The boy was frisky, but still sweet.
The breakfast is already cooked.
The breath has stopped to leave the chest,
The British Muse’s fairytales
The brushes more than thirty breeds
The bullets sink in tubes of pistols,
The bullet went through chest and now
The burning torch, two hearts and bloom,
The bushes, chutes and all of those
The cabmen crowd at the fires,
The chairs are moved and in a squeeze
The charming actresses’ caretaker,
The charming dreams of adoration,
The cheeks just brighter glow and glow,
The cheeks start instantly to blaze,
The children’s hold in secret meetings
The chimney gives the final sighs,
The Christen world will then obtain
The Christmastide has come. All fine!
The circle top with clapping splashes,
The clever husband very soon
The clever mind and soul’s thrill,
The clock is running, time for leaving,
The coffin mysteries dead cold,
The commonwealth can reach a progress,
The company gets up and waits,
The conversation briefly ended,
The conversations and the talks;
The corset, Album and Alina,
The corvee - ancient yoke of peasant
The cot in mystery is drawn.
The cough and clapping have not quiet.
The country, flowers, field spaces,
The country is same boredom, though,
The countryside and its poor dwellers,
The countryside’s Cyclops, at that,
The country’s idleness calm fly.
The country’s morals become rather
The country view and sad gravestone,
The country, where Eugene was boring,
The country woke up long ago,
The couples flicker in the dance.
The cupids, demons, snakes and devils
The cups on saucers just picked up,
The customs of the ancient time,
The damsels standing at the wall,
The damsels tried to look more shy,
The damsels whisper getting quiet;
The dance was over; supper followed,
The dancing couples flood the floor.
The dark is falling like a mist...
(The date reminds when he’d gone)
The day and night, delight and sorrow
The days ran fast; the winter air
The deals and rhymes I shall review.
The decayed fashion do not follow.
The delayed speeches and same dresses,
The dim emotions stirred her soul.
The dishes clatter and the wine
The dishes, corks and petty matters.
The dish(e)s were served complied with ranks.
The dismal jealousy wild torments,
The disputes, verses, cheerful dreams!
The divine wine is always blessed,
The dogs attacked her barking loud.
The double lamps of carriage lines
“The dreams and years have passed, another
The drowsy heart reanimate,
The drums are beating waking soldiers.
The dusk thins out, but no more
The elder does not see the minor
The elegies gush out of him
The elements to me unpleasing,
The elevated expertise...
The elevated Muses’ lyrics
The elite and the fashion models,
The End
The endless country intersect.
The end of waltz with her he dances.
The enemies and friends, as well
The epicurean-sage men,
The estate manager’s report...
The evening samovar made hiss.
The extracts from a northern rhyme,
The fans of whist eight rubbers played,
The fate and life were analyzed,
The fate has counted all these,
The fearful tusks and violent fangs,
The feather beds, cocks in the cages,
The features of a tender girl?
The female cranks of high society!
The fields and woods secluded staying,
The fields attain required freshness,
The fight, the saber and the lead.
The first success encouraged me;
The fishers kindled smoking fire.
The flame is dying, by the ashes
The flaxen curls and tender smile,
The flocking herds and country air;
The flocks make noise, a nightingale
The flocks of darks from banks fly off.
The fluffy furrows pushing high
The flying feet of dancing dames
The fog laid on the bottom lands,
The footfall hasn’t, yet, pacified,
The forest’s shade and waters’ hiss,
The former friends are full of bile,
The former friends, who despise cause,
The former years’ mischief and play.
The fortune law is always sage.
The fragrant tea by dark jet streaming
The freedom-loving reveries,
The freedom’s potentate Fonvisin
The Frenchmen probably would say
The friend of feasts and melancholy,
The friends’ and enemies’ escort
The friends as just an added zero,
The friends of “Ruslan and Lyudmila”!
The frost did sparkle. It is fine,
The frozen panes of windows shine
The fruits of cordial extremes.
The fruits of learning, truth and lie?
The fruits of vigils, inspirations,
The future triumph coming soon
The future troubles would be fatal.
The gambling gangsters ataman,
The gang flashed on and disappeared.
The gang of beasts the girl has found.
The garden alley, lake and forest?
The generations make a round,
The gentlemen bowed a bit lower
The gilded youth by a thick crowd
The girls are at Tatiana hustling;
The glasses tinkled in the frames;
The golden autumn is arising.
The golden crosses shine on domes.
The golden fields and blooming meadows,
The golden youth has passed away!
The grassland, bridges and parterre,
The green card tables are extended
The grievous traces he has left.
The groves were getting dull and bare.
The grudge- by gossip, and sometimes
The guardsmen's spurs are jingling lightly,
The guesses shifted and they found
The guest are leaving satisfied.
The guests are coming. And when staring
The guests calmed down... in the study
The guests in silence wait his saying.
The guests proceed to dining-hall.
The guests start moving to sit denser;
The habit pacified her sorrow,
The hall is crowded with the guests,
The hall is full, the boxes flashing,
The happiness of youthful years
The hasty letter the love figures.
The heart beats faster in a fever
The heart is stirred in exaltation,
The heroes and the heroines...
The high life does not like him, yet.
The high society bright experience,
The high society makes her sick,
The high society’s views and mind...
The high tone makes us pretty bored.
The hills were by snow cover plated.
The holly water will help, maybe,
The honey bliss and freedom’s moments...
The hoofs and awful crooked trunks,
The horses thrashing in the cold
The horse when feeling dead man snorts,
The hostess asked a question, then...
The houseboys at once arrived.
The husband enters terminating
The husband first reached fatal limit,
The husband loved the sweetheart deeply,
The ice turns blue, the people hives.
The idle talks, clamor and quarrel!
The image of this pair of legs.
The impulses of virgin dream
The inconspicuous charming fair,
The innocence can trouble bring”.
The innocence of rural places,
The inns for people entertain.
The instant ballad’s long-term trace
The instant tenderness of eyes,
The invitations, they are saying
Their branches by decor of ice
Their daughters hug Tatiana fondly.
Their gazes are just burning her.
Their inborn virtue unconfined,
Their issue follows same routine...
Their love, or grief, or other feel.
The iron bits makes wet and bites,
Their pastime, meals, plans for tomorrow?
The issue will retain my letter,
The jealous man can celebrate,
The joyful nation of the boys
The kid of luxury and leisure
The kids’ and nurses’ cries and cram.
The killer of the youthful singer?”
The ladies’ faints and bitter tears
The ladies sit by fireside,
The ladies started to move forward,
The lampions shine all around,
The lamps are lighting by a glitter.
The lamps of night on magic dome
The landlord solitary dwelling
The land of fathers, freedoms’ treasure!
The languid glance was full of tears.
The last departure day is close.
The latter is the same club’s member,
The lazy East for long is sleeping,
The Lensky’s fate against the willing
(The Lensky’s village) used to live,
The lessons of the public treats.
The less you show your love to woman,
The letter flickers in her hand,
The letter silently had scanned.
The liberty and rights defender
The life is seeking to produce,
The life of real ancient sage,
The life was sparkling stirring blood.
The light is shining in the window,
The lightness of the passions whirl?
The lilac’s bushes broke and all that
The lips are adorned with a smile;
The lively pictures or catchword,
The lofty chambers all around,
The love can conquer any ages,
The lovely things, I used to find,
The love’s and Petrarch’s tongue and lyre.
The Luna in the sky is shining,
The magic night and Luna’s face...
The magic winter makes us pleased.
The magpies were enjoying this,
The maidens are embraced by dreams,
The maiden's face looked so much sad,
The maidens’ secrets and the thinks
The maids prefer The Pussy Cat.
The maids start weeping, people fuss.
The maids were singing at the bed...
The man, whom she adores so fatal,
The marriage for us will make jail.
The master to the door directs.
The mattresses, preserves in cans,
The memoirs, recollection sources,
The men in front; the crowd drones,
The milestones switch just one by one
The misses frisk expecting something.
The mistress shouts... “Oh, my dear!”
The mocking glances with no word
The modern wedding rings to find.
The mollycoddled fingers even
The moon beyond the hill has ceased,
The moon is showing its pale face
The Moon - night sky illumination,
The moon shy dies away, the valley
The moon’s twilight is in the window
The more attractive, thanks to that
The more in thickets, better hearing
The mores and manners of the ancient.
The morning lily blossom’s stem,
The morning noise refreshes air.
The mortal phantoms resurrect -
The Moscow Fire he received
The Moscow trip to winter times.
The Moscow youthful Graces, first,
The mother suffered separation
The mouths chew, and in the room
The music play, the candles blinking,
The music tiers to make roar,
The mysteries of olden years
The naive souls’ sincere confession.
The naive talks and other nonsense
Then, all the rest time of the year
Then, all this bliss made him asleep,
The nanny opens bedroom door
The nanny said a prayer and
Then, archly smiled, his hand extended
The native morals are corrupted
The nature turns to pale and sad
The nature with a smile arousing
Then cast at Olga vivid eyes
Then, coffee drank and in a drowse
Then, country home, chilled glassy pane,
Then, does not notice him at all...
The neighbor, and please do it soon.
The neighbors shaking pompous heads
The new - the old ones repeat.
The next has come - no reply yet.
Then, he sees slanderers, mean cowards,
The night falls down, and the moon
The night is falling, time to go,
The night is frosty, sky is clear,
The night time shades have started fading,
Then, Lensky comes; the light flashed on;
Then liked each other; shortly they
Then, local dandy Roosteroff,
Then nobody, but you, I swear,
The noise and crush are all around.
The noise of works in fields has died;
Then on a padded chair her places
Then on the sheets with recollections,
The northern wind the clouds driving;
The Novel in Verse
Then, paltry French cared for the kid.
Then please do know, I swear by Heaven,
Then puts his hand on chest and slowly
Then put them back into the case.
Then, Roosteroff - the same, you see.
- Then send your grandson with this note
Then, sudd(e)nly stops, can’t look around,
Then, they began to talk again
Then, they require her confession
Then took a pen and stifling yawn
Then, to the books she paid attention,
The oddity, which was unconscious,
The oily pancakes used to fry.
The olden sorrow stirs me still.
The old ma’am wisdom demonstrating
The old ones could not hold the smiles,
The old ones look quite obsolete,
The old was busy at all times
The Olga’s little friends to play,
The one, which even kids did hear...
The one, whose letter he still keeps,
The one, who’s innocence enjoying,
The one with whom would make a union,
The only heir of all his kin.
The only one, whom I would see
The other circles fairy light,
The other, cold prosaic dreams,
The other day, today, tomorrow
The other drove her off distraction,
The other gained her heart’s affection,
The other lines, and just by these
The other one - the bottles line,
The others are more odd, more scary...
The others’ sorrow and delight
The other stern considerations
The other with a rooster’s head,
The over mature fiance,
The owner of the pauper serfs,
The pallid moon in sky appeared.
The panes by ice were decorated,
The parquet uttered loud groan,
The parti-colored tiles on stoves.
The passion flares and burns and pains,
The passion’s trace looks dead and sad.
The peasants at the masters look.
“The peasants there are rich and wealthy,
The people’s crowd never tired,
The people’s sacramental friends,
The persons, who don’t smile at all;
The Peter’s Castle with its oaks
The Peter’s Palace. Gee up, straight!
The pilgrim should now leave back home.
The pines are rising to the skies,
The pistol squeezing in his hand,
The pistols sparkled at a distance,
The places, where the bloody shade
The poet in a flame of judgment
The poet now is dead, his bride
The Poetry serene and living,
The poet’s flaming conversation,
The poet sleeps and has no feeling,
The poet’s raptures first delight,
The poet’s soul was still aglow
The poet’s spirit has expired.
The poet’s talent could die latent
The poet, who is great and pleasing,
The posts show up white in a distance,
The pranks, unfaithfulness reveal...
The prejudice of naive years,
The pretty subjects, to whom sinning
The price of love by that upgrade.
The priests and neighbors drank and ate,
The prince replied with Eugene walking...
The prophecies by the moon’s sight.
The prophecies you can’t imagine,
The purpose of the human being.
The quarrel flares, all of a sudden
The question made Vladimir sorry,
The race-and-catch or other game
The real learning they replace.
There are mistakes, if to check neatly;
There are no inns and catalogues
There are sharp traces of the nails,
There are two men in uniform...
There, at the brook in shade of limes
There, being in a panic haste
There came the time for youthful play,
The reckless adoration feeling
The reckless heart inspired for
(The recollection interferes)
There golden earring drops from ear.
There, in a late sleep he is seeing
There, in the shadow of the wings
There is a cabin roofed with hay;
There is a fortune telling mirror.
There is a lot of pleasant sites”.
There is a place nearby to mansion,
There is inscription on the stone,
There is no bear, she’s in a lobby.
There is no coquetry in that -
There is no hope! Onegin leaves
There is no life in Olga’s style.
There is no need in gold supply,
There is no road in thicket site,
There is your tempter’s fatal view.
The relatives from far away
There, maybe sometimes he will read
There, old Derzhavin had inspired
There, on the first sheet, you are meeting...
There, Ozerov shared presentations
There’re many bright stars in the night,
There’re no such lie or dirty tricks
There’re no such nonsense, such a froth,
There’s no best award he could get.
There’s none, just remains of the fierce...
There’s no reply. He writes next letter,
There’s plenty neighbors, yes, it is;
There’s unknown yard in front of her,
The reveries like leaves decay.
There you can hear the brook's sweet tone
The rhymes are full of loving nonsense,
The rights, when sudden storms begin.
The ringing laugh and careless joys.
The rings appear by magic train;
The rivals standing on his path,
The river banks and river bed
The river beds and high top ridges.
The river shines in ice attiring
The roads are awful nowadays,
The roads are flat like is a rhyme
The roads in Russia, probably,
The round dances were expiring.
The round swings they liked to swing,
The royal portraits on the walls,
The Russian rhymes began to grasp.
The sacred monogram E. O.
The sacred poetry delire
The same amaze she could not rise
The same through glasses do the olds,
The scenes of dinners and of feast,
The scripts by Tolstoy animated,
These are away, those beyond reaching,
These are dead treasures you’re inspiring!
These covert images retained,
The secret passions of her dreams,
The secret winter troika’s rides;
These enchantresses’ words and glances
These eves at home and all the maids
These fruitless and so gloomy dreams;
These luster, noise and exclamations
The sense of epigraphs could grasp.
The sentries’ calls recalled existence;
These poets blissful, who combined
These pretty legs, and where at present
The serene brook’s murmuring spills.
The serpent does seduce and tempt,
The servants gather at the doors
These talks with sighs of consolation.
These were the mysteries and legends
The sheds and roofs, the fence and yard.
The shelf, where books were set in row,
The shining sky is blue and clear,
The short comments and marks reveal
The shutters locked, the window panes
The sick man writes a letter, then,
The sighs, and tedium, and fake.
The signs and marks cause rumination...
The skeptical essays by Belle,
The sky is blue, the bright sun shines,
The sky was breathing by the autumn
The sleigh now stops. They've come to stay
The sleigh rides and a late dawn play,
The sleigh speeds over the potholes,
The smoke from pipes in chimney dies,
The snow has left the local highlands
The so called friends! And not in vain
The solitude is so severe,
The songs, which are intimate,
The sounds of a cab wheel rumble
The spacious fields are shining silver...
The spring attracts to rural sites,
The spring gives life to him and, thus,
The sprinkling bubbles and the foam
The stage’s vicious fashion maker,
The stalls and armchairs are in boil,
The Stars, and Moon, and Magic Night.
The stately wigs' and red heels' fame
The stead was full of the complaisance;
The still bare forests start to green
The story of the life he lived.
The story rich in sentiments
The stranger at this giant feast
The stranger tongue into home one?
The string is usual... hooded carts
The strophes and rhymes, which now I write,
The stuff is hilled, babushka crosses,
The sun is rising over there,
The sunrise stretches crimson arm
The sun was shining not so often,
The superstitions centuries old,
The sweet discussions with the friends.
The table, sofa, two cupboards,
The tales of Russian nobles’ fortunes,
The talks are postponed for a while;
The tears are close to drop from eyes,
The tears are streaming, looking meek
The tears do stream from Tanya’s eyes.
The tears, the verses and so on?
The tea with liquor has exiled
The term of leave for long expired,
The theatre starts first ballet act.
The theatre tiers glancing over
The thickets, where my days did flow,
The things, which stir her inflamed mind,
The thirst for glory and for prize,
The thirst for goblets still requires
The thoughts and ease in high esteem.
The throe of poetastery,
The time had come, she fell in love.
The time of hopes and tender sorrow,
The time of joyful tempting revels,
The tired lackeys at the doorways
The tongue by which the girl was dreaming
The tragic-nervous demonstrations,
The trendy foe of trendy belles,
The troika roans have pulled the sledge.
The troika tireless, no jerky,
The troubles, boredom and so on.
The trustful naive girl’s confession,
The uhlan got an urgent order
The uncle’s funeral was set,
The valleys dry and blush up brightly.
The vengeance time accelerating,
The vice is punished, after that
The vice is welcomed, in the stories
The villages dropped here and there,
The virgin moan of dreaming pipe.
The virtue gets the triumph wreath.
The virtue is not gloried more.
The volume three by Marmontel.
The walks, deep sleep, relax and reading,
The waltz is spinning, by the circles
The watching eyes are shining brightly.
The waves did drop at feet of thee!
The Weber’s Freischutz at their homes:
The welcome hand and share pastime.
The well-fixed flints are cocked upright;
The well-known youthful theatre sage
The whining skirts and healing prigs.
The whiskers, horns and crested tails,
The willful passions in a swarm.
The wind calmed down in the field.
The wind starts blowing, it gets cold.
The winter finally has come,
The woe had passed, she stopped to pine
The words of melancholic love,
The work, the suffer and the rest,
The world and husband can suspect
The world and reveal real graces.
The world received her with a smile;
The world will stay in pleasant tranquil,
The wrath of love and of lust pleasure
The wrath of sound mind quickly,
The wreath of youth has drooped, alas?
They animated conversation
They are just stupid, nothing more,
They are not worthy of these speeches,
They are old fashioned specimens.
They are the greedy boredom’s heirs.
They argue, laugh, make funny sounds.
The yawning by the laugh restraining...
They bless the ruts of native land
They bring her to a public meeting.
They call him to a samovar,
They cry and noise like in a fable.
They didn’t excel neither by feeling,
They don’t deserve to be displeased.
The years the playful rhyme decline,
The years to severe prose incline,
They gathered berries being ordered
They got in contact and at first
They harness to the sleigh the horses.
They have not left the traces, yet,
They in the parlor exercise
They lay above the fatal fosse.
They’ll cock the pistols, after that
They made the first four dreadful stairs,
They open blinds; smoke by columns
They opened universe to her,
The youthful bliss has passed forever
The youthful sprees initiated,
They place them opposite my dear,
They’re riding back the shortest way
They ring and pour at the lone nook.
They rush to sparkle and to mate,
They sat embraced and sadly cried.
They scuffled with the dogs and thundered,
They send Onegin to hakeem,
They shift the glasses, dishes, chairs
They shout... mine! And all guffaw.
They shovel silver by a spade;
They sing, but just with no attention
They sit and look at a chessboard
They sit in front like bride and groom,
They sit together for a while,
They started to approach in quiet
They start to hug, exchange the kisses
They start to laugh. The guests arrived.
They stay for long remaining silent,
They stay in front in calm and dim
They throw the cloaks to free the hands,
They took a seat, the honored carriage
They to the mill their steps direct.
They used to relish just the lust
They welcomed guests and tried to feed
They were for marriage candidates.
They were their feelings signifying...
They whisper... “Dunya, do you see!"
They will be glad to meet us. - “Wow!
They will resolve the poet’s fate.
They won’t disturb you. Yes, take care!
They won’t with malice grin spell out
Thickets around, dark and snow,
Thirst for the blood and are in quarrel?
Thirty two steps Zaretsky spans;
This couplet sometimes he observed
This detrimental captive story?
This Eve he came to visit me.
This fake delusion brings and heats!
This girl, who didn’t stir any thrill,
This Grandison was brave and smart,
This Hellespont he swam across,
This is a pool, my friends, where I
This letter should Onegin find. -
This lively soul misunderstand?
This minute-long gushing existence.
This nook would evidently bless.
This one is gnawed by recollections,
This so much awful cruel fate?
This so upsetting private stay,
“This stout general, you say?”
This time was wrong that way to render.
This time you shouldn’t neglect the call. -
This tiresome exhausting driving
This tittle-tattle nonsense, though,
This unexpected passion, yet,
Those, who get overall esteem,
Though, also different could happen,
Though could not catch it in detail,
Though, did not know, why is it so)
Though didn’t perceive his talents well,
Though, do not want my tale to end.
Though he considered it in vain
Though, I am far from criticism.)
Though ill-willed people's imperfection
Though, in the past I used to glance
Though, it's enough to glorify
Though late, prelude is done at last.
Though, like all other spiteful jesters,
Though, listen, Lensky, you can treat it,
Though, play or pranks I can’t exclude,
Though, sometimes used to praise and please.
Though, still attractive and quite fair.
Though wasn’t prepared to Eugene’s greeting...
Though, wedding was against desire,
Three homes invite him for tonight...
Three hours he used at least
Three pairs of slender legs you’ll find.
Three tears by each they used to drop,
Three years she’s suffering consumption,
Threw down Lensky, after that
Threw it away, and after all
Through dream is greeting the year dawning;
Through magic crystal it to scan.
Through mannered crowd of beau monde,
Through set teeth just a couple words,
Thus, after farewell to the woman
Thus, alien to the world and sad,
Thus, aunty Helen’s hat with laces
Thus, elder sister’s name Tatiana.
Thus, every evening at Very
Thus, grain in spring when falls on soil,
Thus, he’d left books like did with women,
Thus, he had left his country dwelling,
Thus, highland virgin I did praise,
Thus, I foresee irate reproof.
Thus, Lensky’s speech evoked his smile.
Thus, make a judgment and review.
Thus, my midday has come and I
Thus, not one pencil he had broken
Thus, on a shelf he’d set books row
Thus, people sink into oblivion
Thus, people (yes, I do repent)
Thus, please, accept my real thanks
Thus, stormy shade eclipses light
Thus, they reached Moscow seventh day,
Thus, tortured by the conscience pangs,
Thus, we, today in bloom and silly,
Thus, you can judge, what bunch of rose
Thus, your reliable girl friend
Till now disturbs imagination.
Till now, it’s not the language, which
Till now, my God, I feel so poor,
Till now the female’s love doesn’t need
Till sleepless Breguet rings him that
To agitate high life’s emotions
To all her folks to demonstrate
To all her kin, though I should stay
To all these Circes and spoiled men,
To all these reckless crazy feasts
To amaze innocence by jest,
To appear proud and obedient,
To awful hands of fancy tyrant
To be a poet he didn’t dare,
To bear the heavy wedlock chains,
To be a tribute to the earth.
To be aware of what they think.
To become hardened and to wane
To be exposed to blind Fortune’s
To be expressed in Russian, right
To be extracted from the ages.
To be in the whole world defamed,
To be more modest I prefer
To be so cunning, to betray,
To be unfaithful, who would say!
To bring the barrels and besides,
To burn, then, terminate to foster
To call Moina (to attract
To catcall Ph(a)edra, Cleopatra,
To catch a minute of emotion,
To censor I will pay my debt,
To change routine and thus provided
To change to wood, pigs’ fat and grains,
To chew the couplet in his mind;
To cite against looks controversial,
To clash two centuries I hate.
To conquer us and to amuse,
To contradictions being glad.
Today a simple gravestone lies.
Today, Lovelace has lost attraction,
To demonstrate their great compassions
To demonstrate to high society,
To dig in prehistoric dust,
To dissipate his spouse’s mourn
To dream of seeing you again,
To dreams spontaneous devotion,
To drive the trade, and that makes sense,
To duel barrier bring them, then,
To entertain a half deceased,
To entertain her did succeed.
To entertain imagination
To face an academic being
To feels, to look like sad or bored,
To feign compassion, dose the drugs,
To follow her and cherishes hope;
To follow love and in a while
To follow you at every turn.
To frighten men for them is clever.
To frighten timid love at first,
To get a chance to watch your features.
To get escape when at a distance
To get it. I retain, my friends,
To give descriptions is my business,
To give her lessons in a quiet!
To glance at him she does not dare;
To go to bed quite soon”. And thus,
To guess appropriate escape,
To high life’s noise and vain delight.
To him on tiptoe Tanya speeds;
To his attires in last taste
To his beloved? I heard, they said,
To his fair lady, nice and pleasing!
To his hereditary farm,
To hiss an actor off the stage,
To intercept a lady’s passion,
To journalists - the public wolves.
To jump and play she scarcely would.
To keep a steed and quickly use it
To kiss Armides’ arousing lips,
To know well Russian she'd no need
Told her of that, and just because
To leave this world without traces.
To Lensky Eugene quickly moved.
To listen to the same objections,
To listen to you, comprehend
To look at him she cannot end,
To lose your face - that is the price...”
To love and feels its real taste.
To Lovelace hiding secret feeling.
To maintain spouse and father’s due,
To masquerade drives from abroad.
Tomorrow morning at daybreak
To Moscow, to the fair of brides!
To mourn, to laugh, to title tattle
To move the horses to safe site.
To my light-headed youthful days!
To Neva’s banks for public viewing!
To noisy feasts and raving clamors,
To occupy himself he’d failed.
Too early he got rid of passions
To O... Excuse, to this, to whom...
To Olga since the adolescence,
To ombre, Boston, whist, as well,
To order Olga tea, and later
To organize a friendly lunch,
To other man I am a wife
To others’ rebel passions whirling.
To overcome the ills and ties).
To overhear the first soul’s sigh,
To pacify the mind’s doubt,
To pale and still in great affection!
To pass for sorrowful odd fellow
To pattern cloth with silky trace.
To pay for post-chaise she didn’t want,
To plan to him untimely death
(To please the women and the men
To polish nails and brush the teeth.
To pray and call for a confession,
To press carved signet can’t afford.
To privatize. Here, I say - Yes!
To put the friends at the right place.
To quench by pray grieve burning me?
To quench the cutlets' fiery fat,
To read a magazine desired,
To read here books and stay alone.
To read in Russian. Ah, my friends!
To realize that you do not
To recollect pipe, mask and blade,
To reconcile them, then for triple
To remain silent when debating,
To represent my beauty’s letter.
To reward you more just and fair
To ride horseback in severe steppes?
To rise the sun from morning vale,
To run away, but can’t do that.
To sacrifice his life for rhymes...
To save the honor of my land
To say good by to their landlords.
To scare by recklessness a virgin,
To seclude corner and puts down
To see the world and change the place,
To see you and to hear your speeches,
To set and fluff the pillows, thus,
To shoot himself he did not try,
To show caress she hardly could
To show fake sympathy, then, sigh
To show good judgment and to say
To show to you my naked soul?
To sigh of gloomy Russian being,
To sign the letter not affording
To simulate cold speech and gaze,
To sing in chorus to prevent
To sing the steppe that she was praising.
To smash a vessel of a slander;
To some of these he showed respect,
To speak about yesterday.
To spend in front of tailors’ mirrors,
To spend in revels night and day?
To stain the flighty paper leaves,
To stay for long he did not will,
To stay in backwoods looks more real.
To strive with him or whom you know
To suffer for the money sake
To suffer thirst of love in vain,
To Summer Garden took for walk.
To supersede by will and passion
To swim across the water world;
To take a brake and have a rest...
To take a rest of former stay.
To take a stroll? The country view
To take submissively his way!
To take the keys from entrance doors.
To Tanya brought a famous couplet,
To Tanya’s home, where she is living.
To tell few words to you and then
To tell her fortune dare not try.
To tell the truth, I hate Hymen,
To the babushka in despair.
To the beginning of young day.
To them a great discount made...
To the old aunt, who’s sick, but fair.
To the seductive nets, then, sting
To thunder, capture and escape.
To touch a subject quite a bit,
To touch cute legs my lips were willing!
To use her private string preferred.
To visit this deserted dome,
To watch a sick man day and night
To watch remoteness of the fields,
To watch the murmur of seaside,
To weep, to cry and like a frog
To what had happened far ago.
To whirl with her at guests began,
To whisper what her heart desired,
To whom himself makes only treasure,
To whom of all these jealous lasses
“To whom shall I the note convey?
To whom your heart you dedicated,
To whom your vice is not a trouble?
To whom you wrote with burning soul?
To widow Larina’s estate
To wish to nestle at your knees
To write the letters and complain,
To write the poems more or less,
Tried to chase shade of love in vain.
Tried to perceive the youngster's tale..
Tried to read Schiller, yet, in vain,
Trike is lying on the floor
Trike with paper in his hand
Triumphing victories and pride,
Trustworthy friend, landowner sound,
Turned to the alley to the right...
Twice yearly fast they used to keep,
Two bullets only now await -
Two days he found it quite novel...
Two hearts, maybe, till recent day
Two maidens here were moved by feelings.
Two minutes later after that
Two minutes they were staying silent,
Two Petriadas, grammar, then
Two pines by roots together merge,
Two thin poles bonded by the ice
Uncovering the charming bend…
Under a faded dim moonlight
Under her feet the snow makes squeak.
Under the lee of a small hill,
Under the Schiller-Goethe’s sky;
Undressed and slipped into a bed,
Unearthly dreams, and sweet delusions,
Unfaithfulness made him fatigued,
(Unfortunately over-salted).
Unless the star was still in flight.
Unsafe for hearts of virgin girls)
Used to brine mushrooms and shave recruits,
Used to occur in my flamed mind
Uses to stop at the gravestone.
Use to declaim his solemn poem
Utters the long-drawn-out wails

Vladimir answered to the granny.
Vladimir answered with a frown
Vladimir being rich and handsome
Vladimir closes Schiller’s book
Vladimir Lensky came to visit
“Vladimir Lensky rests in here,
Vladimir Lensky was his name,
Vladimir screwing up left eye
Vladimir started to inscribe
Vladimir was in absent mind,
Vladimir was not able, truly,
Vladimir, when in exaltation,
Vladimir would love to write odes,
Vladimir writes not madrigals;
Vyazemsky at her took a seat,
Walked to the river lightly clad.
Walks by a clearing’s snowy cover
Want see you; yes, you are invited,
Want to part with you as a fellow.
Warmed up, the bitter cold extinguished.
Was after her like crazy chasing.
Was a scenic and charming place;
Was born on Neva’s even shores,
Was breathing on a chilly pane
Was by the neighbors bemoaned much,
Was cared as bridegroom candidate,
Was celebrated as love science.
Was changed by overall excite.
Was criticizing mill design.
Was dressed, undressed and dressed again?
Was heating it by virgin fire.
Was interrupted time to time
Was irritated besides this;
Was it not you, to whom I listened:
Was not at all this time surprised,
Was pleased to talk with him and, thus,
Was so much rankling in my soul!
Was waiting there for a long time.
Was watching how the snow was falling.
Watched how the flame old Moscow bursts.
Watches the wax sunk in the water.
Watching a dream, he’s in a drowse,
Watching him from far away,
Watching Tatiana, no one else,
We all get habit from above,
We both had learned the passions plays...
We both of life were pretty tired,
We can’t ignore the public spirit,
We could be happy, yes, could be.
We’d better gallop to a ball,
We do associate frustration
We greet the pranks of wintertime.
We heard of love or knew, what’s it,
We know, this book does not depict
Welcoming of the coming guests
We leave him there. And how for long?
We like the ladies glide the boards.
We’ll move the mountains and tie
We’ll run off, my sweetheart girls,
We’ll say good bye to my tale’s hero,
“Well, shall we start?” - applied Onegin.
Well, well! My kind noble reader,
- Well, well, Onegin, you are yawning. -
We must respect them and be fair,
Were all in vain with no delight.
Were by the passions entertained;
Were cursing him this way and that.
Were deeply harassing his soul.
Were even worse and much less wise.
We’re glad to take as real deeds,
Were poor in Russian language, yet,
Were soft exciting lavish pleasure.
Were used to guess what’s to them fated,
We see Tatiana on the road,
We shall decoy a young man
We, sometimes, would prefer to listen
We, thanks to God, can flash with breeding,
We think, you’re nice, since lamp replace.
We’ve moored, and should exclaim Hurrah!
We were forgetting all the cares,
We were so speechlessly bewitched!
We wonder what she’s looking in.
What artful nets he spread for those!
What a sweet heartache I am feeling!
What bliss her breast is breathing off!
What can I do! I repeat...
What can I do, when everyone,
What can I tell about them...
What can I tell to you besides?
What can I tell you of these games...
- What can I tell you, Tanya? Sometimes
What can stir up such a strong feeling?
(What can you do, they’re all like that).
What can you read on his pale face?
What caused him wondering and what
What distance is from ice to flame,
What does he hear, my God, my Lord!
What does the kinfolk in fact mean.
What do I want? What is the reason
What else you need? Beau monde could say
What envy was aroused in me,
- What, Grandison? How great he was!
What happened then upon that meeting
What haven’s pride she’s demonstrating,
What I did know, forgotten, yes.
(What I for fun used to reveal)
What is he after self-exile?
What is he doing at this place?
What is it, vanity or else?
What is she dreaming now about?
What is this fearful dreaming meaning?
What is your name? He’s looking on
What looks excited and shines bright
What mean deceitfulness it is...
What my light-headed pen did draw,
What occupied him all the day
What place he’ll go to visit first?
"What’s going on, and where is that,
What’s going on? Is it a dream!
What shall he do with all of that!
- What shall I do with my Tatiana? -
What’s planning to me coming morning?
- What’s with you, Tanya? - “I am boring,
What they were used to call cartel,
What trifle brought you to this session!
What was for him from infant’s years
What was response? The stern reflection.
What was that secret volume kind,
What were his beliefs in the prime?
What were the tribes negotiations,
What will he demonstrate today,
What will you feel, when it was you
What you do have - does not attract,
When above Neva, the white night
When after speedy heady running
When ancient song to her announced...
When at that time headache disturbs;
When being home, he checked the pistols,
When being poured on pistol’s rack.
When being told at night in winter.
When cheeks aglow will disappear.
When choosing clothing was a prig
When coming home, at home as well
When doing that, two or three pages,
When dusting post-chaise speeded him,
When estimating my old friend?
When five more steps they both had made,
When hearing how a forest breathes?
When hearing it I think about
When he hadn’t learned love tortures, yet,
When he remained in self exile,
When he spent time in this delight
When hidden under table cloth,
When I can... - “Here, again eclogue!
When I’d got rid of public burden
When I forsook their young communion
When in a corner sat alone.
When in the pale sky night stars glowing
When it avails a simple produce.
When it is blowing on my face
When it’s best time for it to grow”.
When I was a poetic guy.
When I was fond of Apuleius
When I was staying far apart,
When moon was following the steed!
When naughty boy detains poor thing,
When passions and excitement fever
When reading passions of his soul
When rides headlong in fields alone
When saw him coming with sunrise.
When saying words, she nasalized;
When semicircles of the gardens,
When shall I leave this boring order?
When she in menswear being clothed
When she was at the lobby stairs,
When snow is painted in pink color,
When staining albums overall;
When suddenly somewhere from doorway
When the environment did tremble,
When the good willing education
When they bring little notes; all right,
When they were strolling nearby,
When touches by her feet the earth!
When used to live and I, and you),
When viewing her from top to toes,
When viewing her goes into raptures,
When waking up he does not know,
When waking up, he gets a letter
When was deceived - take rest so far.
When was declined - no painful duties,
When we shall resort at a banner
When will relax heart stirring whirls,
When you are old, life is so vile...”
When your life stream is turning back,
Where a dull husband knows her value,
Where after changing of the clothes
Where against me today they prate,
“Where are the days of my life blossom?
Where are the stormy amorous passions,
Where are the traces of the tears?
Where at the courtyard’s entrance door
Where author knows the nature more than
Where being in a dream one day
"Where do you go? These crazy poets!”
Where do you plan to spend the eve?”
Where do you think my hero rides?
Where Dunya pours a cup of tea,
Where dwelled the kid of inspiration...
Where every line with ardor speaks,
Where everyone feels free and sage
Where flows her native lovely brook,
Where Fortune put us face to face,
Where foster child of the fashion
Where he appeared to her sometimes.
Where heeding my sonorous strophes
Where he met Tanya face to face.
Where he spent time like ground hog,
Where in an estate nearby
Where in the calm the waters shined
Where in the evening he will go.
Where I serenely bloomed in peace,
Where is first chapter’s very end.
Where is he? God knows. He is lost.
Where is Onegin? Half asleep,
Where is the pleasure of my dreams,
Where master used to sit in quiet.
Where my tale’s hero dwelled alone.
Where nothing can disturb or hit them;
Where now the cross and branches’ shade
Where reapers use to play and jest
Where sermons they reiterate,
Where she’s a subject of a talking.
Where swans were calling in the valleys,
Where Thalia has lightly dozed,
Where the old timer for great whiles
Wherever, always the same dreaming,
Where will proceed my naughty partner?
Where you, a madman, could forget
Where you and I first time had met,
Where you spent time in winter season,
Which among men of upright fashion
Which by no means could be repulsed,
Which called us to the night time strolls
Which differ my and Eugene’s souls.
Which he excluded from disgrace...
Which his shy daughter did enjoy.
Which in the days I told above
Which kills the old with no compassion.
Which lies immovable on earth?
Which made excited and were fearful,
Which makes a mystery to us,
Which never had and never has
Which people in the country features
Which, probably, were home of yours,
Which’s covered by the old pines’ shadow.
Which should be all his life’s the best.
Which should be cleared long time ago
Which should be rhymed with youth extremes?
Which’s of a similar communion,
Which spins inside a reddish hat;
Which till today is highly valued.
Which touches languid heart for real,
Which twists and runs on a green meadow
Which was not touched in grass’s wilds
Which you will never have enough.
While cheerful look at you remaining!
While she is graciously proceeding
Who all his glory, cash and ranks
Who all the movements, all the readings
Who are you, maybe, guardian angel,
Who at the Neva’s banks does reign.
(Who badly treated was not once),
Who being fifty was released
Who, both, in trouble and in sorrow,
Who by experience is chilled,
Who by indifference are featured,
Who by response, immodest view
Who came to the estate sometimes
Who can’t be captured by the feelings,
Who causes nothing but a yawn, -
Who chilled his love by a departure,
Who cold of being endured smooth
Who comes to share my boring table,
“Who could imagine? Oh, my Lord!
Who could not recognize the feeling
Who could not see her pain at that!
Who did not play and never tried
Who does not sow a bitter slander,
Who dreams and feels like in passed days,
Who drew me to a great amaze,
Who entertained themselves by feasts.
Whoever are you, my verse reader,
Whoever was my hero, yet,
Who fight for heirloom, spite and curse.
Who for the ladies make a frame.
Who gave the necessary order!
Who hasn’t read to the end Its story,
Who have not learned the being lessons
Who inspirers your poetic tone,
Who is a dreamer in this world
Who is by naive faith inspired,
Who is destined to her by fortune...
Who is immoral, selfish, cold,
Who is it, in a crimson hat,
Who is like morning moonlight pale
Who is Tatiana’s addressee?
(Who judge severely, but fairly)
Who liked the deceased and disliked
Who’ll be your second?” - neighbor said.
Who’ll never cheat you or betray?
Who looked so stately and so fairy,
Who loved the youth by all his soul,
Who loves to overwhelm the guests
“Who loves you more than I do thee
Who made proposal, was rejected...
Who marvels viewers, mostly young
Whom can you trust? Where love can find?
Whom dashing cabs at time of night
Whom did your verses idolize?”
Whom did you see in your night dreams?”
Whom I remember and admire,
Whom she adores, who causes scare!
Whom she preferred and adored more.
Who never suffered jealous torture,
Who never trusted to odd fables,
Who now are reaching the gravestones
“Who now arouses your lyre’s fever?
Who prompted her this tender passion
Who prompted touching voice to her,
Who radiates the bliss, etcet(e)ra,
Who’s always perfect, utters bliss,
Who’s always positive and kind,
Whose feeling he was just ignoring;
Whose feels are absolutely honest.
Whose gaze, exiting inspiration,
Whose jokes were so much outdated
Whose mind is above fake shame.
Whose spiteful mind is restless,
Whose thankful favorable hand
Who shared with him the happy life.
Who’s ready to be killed for friend
Who’s with you always nice and tender?
Who the cold mind can distract,
Who to him sometimes wrote a note;
Who to the country likes to travel,
Who’ve shot a young and pleasant pal,
Who was in twenty fop or bold,
Who was more clever and less shy,
Who was same silent as Svetlana,
Who was so frank, whose soul was burning;
Who was to epigrams so greedy
Who won’t annoy, like does the other?
Who wouldn’t be bored to simulate,
Who wouldn’t be worn by threats and lies,
Why are you chasing me today?
Why did Vladimir disappear?
Why did you come to visit us?
Why do you now single me out?
Why is Tatiana guiltier then?
“Why yesterday you’d vanished early?”
Widow Clicquot or famous Moet,
Will aim each other’s thigh or head.
Will animate my soul at once!
Will be erased from human’s mind.
Will be extended, thanks to that
Will be remembering the past?
Will be remembering the past?
Will bring to us these Hymen’s plays,
Will change completely and, in fact,
Will die, and we shall see just fun
Will disappear, leave me in quiet.
Will get used to and stop to love;
Will native grammar start to learn,
Will never come again, has gone,
Will never mention it sometimes.
Will not at all disturb my soul,
Will not be lost in later date;
Will occupy me being old man.
Will of the poet’s life remind.
Will organize a trap and bring
Will pet the laurels of old man!
Will step erecting wide and high.
Will still deserve somebody’s bow,
Will understand the Russian term,
Wise cracker, newly from Tambov,
Witch, hedgehog, snowdrift, cot, fir, bear.
With a coarse salt of public spite
With alien to my homeland names,
With all these jams and nonstop talks
With all these jams and treats, indeed,
With all these tiresome resources,
With an obedient doll the girl
With a note by the poet written.
With best regards and other greetings.
With cherries and raspberries
With children of the plural age
With covered by hat dull brow stands.
With cries flied south. Summer’s leaving.
With deceased Lensky - neighbor lord.
With double windows always locked
With dreams of my reflective soul.
With droopy head sits at the lamp;
With enmity, and hope, and love,
With enmity the poet seethes
With Eugene by the dark concealed.
With friends and wife could not hold sighs,
With frosty silver dust was shining
With grief and sorrow in her eyes
With groan said the senile mother. -
With handsome face and who is clever,
With him Tatiana always sleeps,
With housekeeper used to ramble,
With ice not bonded gray-haired stream.
With icy cold instantly poured,
With Juvenal he was best friend,
With lapse of time (and calculation
With Lensky unexpected friction,
With my Onegin to make friends.
With Nina Vronsky, who, you see,
With no astonishment or anger...
With no coarse subjects or nitpicking.
With no concern she hears their speeches,
With no grammatical mistakes.
With no preface and just right now
With no restraints, in bloom and healthy?
With Olga strange behave, besides,
With one thing being just annoyed,
With open heart, like poet’s being,
With other charmed but not for long,
Without all that bagatelle,
Without cards, balls, verses’ rhythms.
Without diligence succeeding
Without elegiac plays,
Without malice or intention;
Without noise, without light,
Without palaces and streets,
Without purpose, with no job,
Without questions or emotions
Without straining, simply chatting
Without wife, by spleen entailed
“With pleasure, sweet heart, just direct”.
With quite familiar contents.
With “Russian Journal” in their hands!
With soul embraced by sorrow feeling
With soul like born in Gottingen,
With Spain Ambassador now talking?”
With sparkles at the bright sun shining
With Tanya, who was too sincere.
With the young years is slipping by
With waves I was embraced by feeling,
With whom you dared to be sincere,
With you I drop my tears today,
With young Semenova; just there
With young Venetian spend time.
With you take bath and feel so fine!
Would be a cuckold at his wife.
Would be a husband’s faithful spouse.
Would be a mother nice and kind,
Would die in peace among his kids,
Would ever I hear freedom chiming?
Would ever she had been aware
Would ever you feel satisfied
Would make them bosom friends again!
Would yell at me and then get rid. -
Would you pour tears, and think of me,
Would you, sometimes, esteem my love?

Yes, for the poet you feel sorry...
Yes, he had learned the people well,
Yes, he has come ... It’s cleared the sight;
Yes, he resembled quite a poet,
Yes, I do love it, my Elvina,
Yes, in my soul there is no doubt
Yes, it will play! It was the colonel,
Yes, Satan likes with love to play!
Yes, she was fond of Richardson
Yes, she was puzzled by the meeting,
Yes, take it please, my eager reader!)
Yes, Tanya my tale’s hero sees,
Yes, Tanya, old, and can’t wit sanely,
Yes, they are close to destination,
Yes, you are perfect, he has got
- Yes, you are right indeed requiring
Yes, your sincerity is cute,
Yet, care for beauty of your nails,
Yet, entertained by hollow dreams
Yet, Moscow said to him just “No!”,
Yet, not the girl stirred by the feeling,
Yet, not too firm in estimations,
Yet, not without heave a sigh
Yet, saying nothing but God damn you,
Yet, there were several proceedings,
Yet, to make him a really dead
Yet, wasn’t it Ladies Magazine,
You also saw that breed of cranks.
You are alone and with persistence
You are exhausted, let’s complete.
You are familiar, my own.
You are in fever... - “Not at all,
You, both, in disquiet and in quiet;
You came to me in the night visions,
You can be a pragmatic person,
You can complain that, probably,
You cannot claim any rejection;
You can’t avoid a hungry night.
You can't make everybody glad,
You’d be a pledge of good to me,
You’d better stay in safe surround.
You dedicated your lyre’s graces?
You’d gain the tempting high life rate?
You did not find me be pleasant.
You did see and not once, no doubt,
You don’t like visits, people say,
You drink desire’s magic venom,
You dropped in twice, and disappeared.
You, epic Muse I am admiring!
You gave a lesson, I did learn.
You have forgotten praise for songs,
- You have not been presented, yet?
You just came in, and in a moment
- You just the solemn odes require!
You know, my friend, how can it be...
You know, Onegin, all this brilliance
You know, Tatiana found relish
You learn the pangs of adoration,
You, Levshin’s school of being fans,
You’ll fell in love again. Same time...
You’ll never do, it’s passed away;
You’ll never have a chance again;
You’ll never hear for a full day
You’ll never meet in this void world.
You’ll perish, darling, but before
You’ll start to weep, but tears of yours
You may disdain me and moreover
Young generation of the past
Young Vladimir is fascinated
Your best friend with a smile not once
Your cold reprimand and your gaze.
Your cold response and sense abuse
You really rouse in Russian soul!
You’re followed by an unreal dream
You’re growing pale again, my dear!”
You’re looking for the same tomorrow.
Your eyes will radiate disdain,
“Your friend doesn’t visit us for long,
Your honor for me is a bail,
Your letters and the love expressions.
Your lovely gaze impelled my thrill,
Your perfect features and are fair.
Your severe look will find proof
Your visits really enjoying.
Your voice I heard in my illusions
You scarcely would be too much glad.
You shall not leave my heart alone.
You should agree with me, my reader,
You should control yourself, be wary.
You should not chase me anymore.
You shouldn’t come to listen to
You shouldn’t deny that in the desert,
You’ve given up your life and fame.
“You’ve grown up, Tanya! But, how odd!
You’ve paid for recklessness quite fair.
You've spent the treasure of young days,
You want say thank you? - Not at all!
You were a subject of my verses,
You were correct with me and fair
You were in love, sometimes, of course.”
You were the first whom he ignored;
You, who are flaming, smart and clear,
You will be followed by my Muse
You wouldn’t deny, shy girl’s affection
You wrote in secrecy your rhymes,
Zaretsky after the first greeting
Zaretsky and the honest fellow
Zaretsky didn’t need explanations,
Zaretsky held his scathing tongue
Zaretsky Lensky’s body rolls
Zaretsky, rural engineer,
Zaretsky, sometimes hooligan,
Zizi, do you remember me?

Or Scott, or Byron or Seneca,
Can you let me see your Phyllida,
A clear, sensible idea,
Tatiana hearing this idea
And beckon boats' sails in the sea.
Where Dunya pours a cup of tea,
And shortly ringing voice of Olga
But in the album of young Olga
Inserted boldly oh, belle Tania.
But all in vain, Martyn Zadeka
My friends, it was Martyn Zadeka,
She’s simple but a nice babushka.
He shook the rein - “Gee up, Andryushka!
The friends of “Ruslan and Lyudmila”!
She’s at the window, and Diana
But sudden fear has seized Tatiana...
In rooms of Olga and Tatiana
Thus, elder sister’s name Tatiana.
Can you tell me, who’s there Tatiana?”
Tatiana, charming girl Tatiana!
Onegin’s letter to Tatiana
Onegin gently brings Tatiana
“How are the neighbors? How’s Tatiana?
- What shall I do with my Tatiana? -
And I, remembering Svetlana,
Who was same silent as Svetlana,
It warmed up tea in pot from China
The corset, Album and Alina,
Backed to Akul’ka from Selina
And there, instead of oh, belle Nina
In winter time, when ballerina
Yes, I do love it, my Elvina,
And Pelageya Pantelevna
Who radiates the bliss, etcet(e)ra,
Diana’s breast and cheeks of Flora
To catcall Ph(a)edra, Cleopatra,
Is Neva’s famous Cleopatra,
Behave like your foremother Eva...
Ruffianoff speeds by Triflyakova.
Lensky - to Tanya, Pygmykova,
It happens, he recites to Olya
Doesn’t use first snow from roof of banya
In secret she arranged in banya
Please, don’t be angry with me Tanya,
About what is dreaming Tanya?
But now all drawn in darkness, Tanya...
She came to the departing cab
He draws an ancient Venus tomb,
Or a repose of your hard job,
Without purpose, with no job,
Compassioned, on a bunch of herb
For mature maidens he is superb
And, wow! From local town’s suburb
By puzzlement the heart disturb
Be reputed as feigned eccentric
She was awaiting something bad.
Neglected bridges are too bad,
Had understood it pretty bad
Before right term to follow dad.
Tatiana feels like a half dead;
Yet, to make him a really dead
She crossed the stream and went ahead,
A kerchief on her gray-haired head.
And aim at his pallid forehead
Lel spins and twists above her head.
Will aim each other’s thigh or head.
- It does not matter, turn your head...
And on her shoulder bends his head...
A crawfish sits on spider’s head,
The other with a rooster’s head,
The fight, the saber and the lead.
But any novel take and read,
Even in absolutely dread...
There, maybe sometimes he will read
Some native books he also read
And cannot, cannot stop to read.
And native magazines didn’t read.
Walked to the river lightly clad.
Are vanity, and I’ll be glad
And he was joyful being glad
To contradictions being glad.
You scarcely would be too much glad.
It did not make the neighbors glad,
You can't make everybody glad,
God willing, I’ll be very glad,
He’d made me by that pretty glad!
That started to behave like mad,
A witch with beard behaves like mad,
Some of them really got mad,
Or a fast hare crossing a road
To masquerade drives from abroad.
We see Tatiana on the road,
The passion’s trace looks dead and sad.
Thus, alien to the world and sad,
The nature turns to pale and sad
A chasm, which is so dark and sad...
Of former Tanya, shy and sad!
And strolls without purpose, sad...
- She is the one who’s looking sad,
The maiden's face looked so much sad,
Like Child Harold sullen, sad,
For whom she pines, who makes her sad,
And for a long time he was sad.
And full of premonitions, sad,
A dream now pleasing and now sad.
And seeing them looked very sad.
Here is my hero, sad and odd.
Sit down, darling, it’s so odd!
“You’ve grown up, Tanya! But, how odd!
Undressed and slipped into a bed,
And drops of tears, and at the bed
The maids were singing at the bed...
In gorgeous style first snow described
And weepy verses had inscribed
A secret of the nuptial bed,
And after waking straight from bed
And with a book still stays in bed,
And drives back home to go to bed;
The river banks and river bed
And being by regret absorbed
Her soul by omens was disturbed,
On an unsteady shaky bed,
A heap of books, a lonely bed,
By easy quitrent had replaced,
It trapped him, in dark corner placed.
It’s on the table quickly placed.
And by Morpheus was embraced
By mannered posture he advanced;
When ancient song to her announced...
And, thus, she finally pronounced
In windows shadows are produced
But it is late, the light has faded,
Onegin bored, and then decided,
A goose on reddish feet decided
To change routine and thus provided
A chemise on the neck has folded
I can foresee, you’ll be offended
Then, archly smiled, his hand extended
Despise to me will be extended!
The green card tables are extended
The conversation briefly ended,
But a princess, aloof, cold-blooded,
To entertain her did succeed.
With all these jams and treats, indeed,
Olga’s sweet image; it’s, indeed
They welcomed guests and tried to feed
The blood from smoking wound does bleed.
To know well Russian she'd no need
If not, then, Eden you don’t need.
Till now the female’s love doesn’t need
Like Lenora with me did speed,
When moon was following the steed!
Sits on a scraggy shaggy weed.
His satire plays with triumph staged,
But suddenly all that has changed
And thus, eight times positions changed.
And to eighteen years sage belonged.
We were so speechlessly bewitched!
And to a scanty language switched
Like sleepy convict being switched
All disappeared... Tatiana sighed.
And spoke singsong and deeply sighed;
That’s what the nature has established
Had noticed that Vladimir vanished
Poor Lensky tragically perished.
Warmed up, the bitter cold extinguished.
So accidentally was ravished.
When she in menswear being clothed
Like London dandy he was clothed
In both the flame in heart had died,
In the Moldova’s steppes he died.
And can it be that my soul died,
The noise of works in fields has died;
IIs he the same or pacified?
The footfall hasn’t, yet, pacified,
Some of them even clarified
It was by parents sanctified.
And, by his fortune satisfied,
The guest are leaving satisfied.
Would ever you feel satisfied
That - by repentance occupied,
“Gee up” - the eager cabman cried;
They sat embraced and sadly cried.
Someone hysterically cried.
He would leave muses and get married.
And snorts; the rider being worried
Tatiana in confusion hurried
Who did not play and never tried
In a sheepskin with red sash tied
He just comes in and is attacked
Onegin stayed upset and shocked.
By this unfaithfulness been shocked?
And gallops being deadly shocked.
With double windows always locked
Who liked the deceased and disliked
The breakfast is already cooked.
With Eugene by the dark concealed.
Both, love and rhythms and by that doubled
He thought that Olga would be troubled
And by the heartache not more troubled
She is disturbed, her soul is troubled
To occupy himself he’d failed.
But then delayed because they failed
Without wife, by spleen entailed
But will and mind had prevailed,
The tea with liquor has exiled
From beloved Italy exiled
Who by experience is chilled,
Involuntary or good willed.
And by the common sense is willed!
Since he was yawning when he strolled
In dining room on chairs have settled.
It’s by the heaven’s council settled…
And, wow, they bring so nicely bottled
Or being by a nuisance throttled
And by his visit would be puzzled.
By all what happened she is puzzled.
To be in the whole world defamed,
But we… by nothing being famed,
Could be high valued and esteemed,
A mournful monument proclaimed...
My husband by the war is maimed,
Was it not you, to whom I listened:
She by her blood the albums signed,
And Werther by the passions chained,
Tatiana at her place remained.
And in his songs with pride retained
But just no features have retained.
These covert images retained,
He, being lucky man, maintained,
By naive pastime entertained,
Were by the passions entertained;
And all the neighbors entertained.
In single image were combined
These poets blissful, who combined
Their inborn virtue unconfined,
Ambitiously unconfined,
Where in the calm the waters shined
Onegin them as well declined,
I know that my age is determined,
By rhythms and anguish being pined
That’s by the heaven predestined.
And wasn’t she by this trouble ruined
The letter silently had scanned.
He, who did feel, he is imprisoned
All that the study room adorned,
How was he languishing tightlipped,
My eyelids for illusions dropped,
I shed the tears, was scared and feared,
And Tanya does not feel so feared,
Matchmaker at my home appeared
You dropped in twice, and disappeared.
The gang flashed on and disappeared.
The pallid moon in sky appeared.
But you are already prepared!
They scuffled with the dogs and thundered,
They gathered berries being ordered
As consolation to me whispered
Nobody at that time discovered
Besides, for them he also hired
And winter’s splendid bliss admired.
There, old Derzhavin had inspired
She was that one who had inspired
Since poets by their Muse inspired
Who is by naive faith inspired,
Being by music roar inspired,
By singer of Corsair inspired,
And by the public mobs inspired,
And was sincerely inspired
My Muse had come, when love expired,
The term of leave for long expired,
The poet’s spirit has expired.
To read a magazine desired,
But Lensky not at all desired
To whisper what her heart desired,
And after that her look turned tired,
Now even pleasure makes me tired,
The people’s crowd never tired,
Like him she used to be attired
The beauties in light gowns attired,
We both of life were pretty tired,
A lot of papers, which required
An old abandoned sleigh required,
Even few words. Though, she inquired,
To feels, to look like sad or bored,
The high tone makes us pretty bored.
He song sad parting and deplored
You were the first whom he ignored;
And guild of writers was disfavored.
To use her private string preferred.
And in his mind he is transferred
Onegin was vividly stirred,
Tatiana’s heart he really stirred.
A daring thought at once occurred.
With icy cold instantly poured,
Who by indifference are featured,
And she, who by my Muse was featured
Blessed is the one, who’s on time matured,
Onegin was besides that pictured.
Just for a moment can be captured,
And by the Frenchmen being captured
And left just never being captured
His courage ready to be tortured.
Or Melmoth by the phantoms tortured,
To entertain a half deceased,
The moon beyond the hill has ceased,
Who being fifty was released
Go visit them; they will be pleased.
They don’t deserve to be displeased.
By reading Cicero displeased.
By his foolhardiness displeased.
The magic winter makes us pleased.
By neighbors visits she’s not pleased,
By Adam Smith was really pleased,
By liberty and glory pleased,
And by alarming dreaming chased,
Onegin was by boredom chased
And by severe khandra was chased,
By grievous premonitions chased,
So much, so many Fate erased!
She feels unwell, her breast high raised.
As an Ideal and high praised…
Not for the first time he surprised
Was not at all this time surprised,
All are amazed, Lensky surprised
Which by no means could be repulsed,
Here, he ate coffee and reposed,
Eugene’s fate, though, was well disposed...
In caps and roses, ill-disposed;
At first, a Madame cared and nursed,
How many days and years have passed?
So many, many days have passed
(He looks upset and pretty harassed).
He’s strict and not at all embarrassed.
Nobody by love can be blessed,
By god of inspiration blessed
The divine wine is always blessed,
And we are by the court caressed,
And, then, he dressed...
And being by a void depressed
And thus, feel jealous and confused.
And will be by a grove amused
But finally he is aroused
Here was an envoy, who debated
To whom your heart you dedicated,
By the last fame intoxicated,
All that has now dilapidated,
Whose jokes were so much outdated
Were used to guess what’s to them fated,
That’s how Yazykov instigated
The youthful sprees initiated,
The hills were by snow cover plated.
And so amusingly translated,
By Olga’s nice smile animated
The scripts by Tolstoy animated,
Tatiana charmed and fascinated
Young Vladimir is fascinated
Enchanting Muse illuminated
Just Lord knows whom he’s celebrated.
By ancient rite they celebrated
The panes by ice were decorated,
By his brush nimbly decorated
At least regret they demonstrated,
And what? By the love saturated
And being disorientated
His ardent heart is captivated
But then, by household distracted,
And being by the life affected
He wasn’t at all by that affected,
Who made proposal, was rejected...
By Zeus’s supreme will elected
It was what a young rake expected,
A worthy mansion was erected
Just here, the Kremlin’s key awaited
Is always by false shame excited.
Want see you; yes, you are invited,
(Unfortunately over-salted).
Tatiana will be represented
He song the love to love devoted,
From education we’ve adopted,
The native morals are corrupted
Like dreams a virgin openhearted,
Unfaithfulness made him fatigued,
So much confused and so fatigued
She was entirely fatigued,
Esteemed his spirit, also valued
Which till today is highly valued.
And ran away, I was pursued.
He was too young to be depraved
He cherished hope and was deceived
The Moscow Fire he received
That pity in his soul conceived...
A swarm of thoughts in him conceived.
At least, for fame he was conceived;
The story of the life he lived.
The houseboys at once arrived.
Poetic Muse to me arrived.
And shortly to the mill arrived.
They start to laugh. The guests arrived.
Morpheus did not, yet, arrived,
At the same time nearby arrived
Of where I suffered, where I loved,
But suddenly a snowdrift moved,
To Lensky Eugene quickly moved.
It looked like he was really moved,
This couplet sometimes he observed
And all the subjects she observed
And had decided... it deserved
Chilled sparkling wine; yes, it was served
By the desires slowly gnawed,
Nobody noticed her or viewed.
A spark of tenderness you showed,
Like in the absent mind followed
And I, maybe, by sad doom followed
The dance was over; supper followed,
Only in January it snowed.
In misty Germany he’d borrowed
In the past century delayed;
The fans of whist eight rubbers played,
And singing songs to church conveyed.
Onegin usually conveyed
All speaks of him. She is annoyed
With one thing being just annoyed,
She is in fever, she’s amazed,
And by his view was not amazed.
Severely judged and criticized.
Her languish look by Moon was seized,
And little by little he got seized
He used to be completely seized.
But soon all that was finalized;
That’s how Onegin moralized.
When saying words, she nasalized;
That it’ll be sad not recognized
And at the same place memorized
I retain how you were baptized!”
Where Thalia has lightly dozed,
The fate and life were analyzed,
And over it a Scottish plaid;
Are leveled with a fluffy plaid.
And at a place his ash was laid
But they with cry undid by braid,
Since all that time he was afraid
“Poor Yorick - dolefully he said, -
“Here is my second - Eugene said. -
- I think, we shall, - Vladimir said.
Who’ll be your second?” - neighbor said.
“That’s that, he’s killed”, - the neighbor said.
To his beloved? I heard, they said,
“I’ll perish”, Tanya faintly said,
Or, what can be? ... Oh, God forbid!
Could ever say, when being candid,
No one would say that she is splendid,
Like nothing bad she ever did,
Don’t do again same thing you did,
Then, paltry French cared for the kid.
Would yell at me and then get rid. -
Of friends and friendship he got rid,
The wind calmed down in the field.
Her love, abandons like a child,
It made him resolute and bold,
But sometimes I was keen and bold,
Who was in twenty fop or bold,
The coffin mysteries dead cold,
I’ll be bystander sad and cold,
I’ll be bystander sad and cold,
November brought first snow and cold.
The horses thrashing in the cold
He song the withered being cold
Who is immoral, selfish, cold,
Clap hands and idle masters scold.
The wind starts blowing, it gets cold.
She’s not loquacious and not cold,
(From two to thirty years of old),
And like I did in days of old
In thirty matched like found gold;
Come to my chamber made of gold!
And that’s how they were growing old.
Among the fields she had to hold,
Stepped over the Beyond threshold
Just stepping over grave’s threshold.
A boring season at threshold;
“My cordial friend, but I am old ...
The superstitions centuries old,
A poet who’s eighteen years old?
And was not, yet, eighteen years old.
Has lived till twenty six years old
And looking at the moon she told...
By pleasant words the people told
Believe in what her heart has told?
You’ll never meet in this void world.
And watching through lorgnette the world
And watching through lorgnette the world
For long he used to fool the world...
He, as before, disclaims the world.
He was ignoring the whole world.
In the beyond of civil world
It is quite new in Russian world
To swim across the water world;
And feel quite lonely in their world,
She should depart from Eugene’s world.
Who is a dreamer in this world
How well complied with the great world!
She had discovered a new world.
He’ll shortly leave the naughty world.
To show caress she hardly could
Since not for long he could and would
To jump and play she scarcely would.
Regrets for an unworthy husband
She’s scared to look behind and
Not once to deal the marriage, and
Whose thankful favorable hand
Crossed Tanya with a senile hand.
The letter flickers in her hand,
A long sharp knife in Eugene’s hand
The pistol squeezing in his hand,
Trike with paper in his hand
His gesture, and leaned on his hand
Of right to kiss her senseless hand...
They bless the ruts of native land
It’s time to leave the boring land,
And put in pawn the estates’ land.
To save the honor of my land
And had accepted that demand.
And ditches of the Russian brand.
He starts to play, game over and
The nanny said a prayer and
Just over there, where people stand,
How could he innocence withstand,
In front of you in thrill to stand,
So far as I can understand,
This lively soul misunderstand?
His dad could not that understand,
His merits and don’t understand
Onegin came to window and
Avoid to drop a curtsy; and
Uncovering the charming bend…
I’ll to submissive prose descend;
The End
And am not scared to see the end;
My father blessed me in the end.
He leaves the partners in the end,
He ceased to like it in the end -
And became bankrupt in the end.
To listen to you, comprehend
Of doing nothing get a friend.
Faublas’s old-established friend,
When estimating my old friend?
But you, Bordeaux, like a close friend,
Thus, your reliable girl friend
Pensiveness was her best girlfriend
He’s shooting with his former friend.
Who’s ready to be killed for friend
And easy life, my novel’s friend!
With Juvenal he was best friend,
Monsieur Guillot is my best friend,
“But boredom troubles me, my friend!”
I won’t tell you today, my friend,
That’s how the century does mend!
Though, do not want my tale to end.
Does not comply with modern trend.
And love the country’s modest trend,
Put vale in the letters end.
Meanwhile, the night comes to its end.
To look at him she cannot end,
Rereading letter can not end.
Did, do and always will extend
And in last chapter’s very end
Where is first chapter’s very end.
Might hope and just a chance could find
At least two verses he could find.
A cordial friend I’d maybe find,
And I am sure you will find
Indeed, on these sheets you will find
Three pairs of slender legs you’ll find.
Whom can you trust? Where love can find?
I stroll and nobody can find
“I can’t imagine worse than find
And that is why we often find
This letter should Onegin find. -
The lovely things, I used to find,
It is unbearable to find
My brain gives up escape to find
Or dismal glance will fail to find
Or dismal glance will fail to find
The modern wedding rings to find.
How to escape from debts to find.
But the right words he cannot find.
Can replace happiness, but find
His flaming soul will shortly find.
I cannot leave this in behind,
Of the admirers on behind.
I hope the rhymes I’ve left behind
And which today I’ve left behind.
Would be a mother nice and kind,
Who’s always positive and kind,
What was that secret volume kind,
A sickness of an unknown kind,
But you, the husbands, were so kind
But, maybe, pictures of that kind
The things, which stir her inflamed mind,
Used to occur in my flamed mind
“That’s it, now go”. And in cold mind
Coquette makes judgment in cold mind,
The high society’s views and mind...
And Eugene only did remind.
Will of the poet’s life remind.
Since they of primitive remind
The adjuration will remind...
A heroine who will remind
And all, what of me can remind,
Squeezes her heart and does remind
And sharp and ice cold style of mind.
Concerned with your slow witting mind?
That still imprisoned his young mind.
Goddess inscrutable for mind,
From Eneida in his mind
And animated in his mind
He thought he’s loved, and in his mind
To chew the couplet in his mind;
And what did never learn his mind,
Will be erased from human’s mind.
He tried this time the others' mind
And by the way, the poet’s mind
Vladimir was in absent mind,
“But perish from him I won’t mind.
That friendship with him did not mind...
He absolutely did not mind,
He stays in bed and does not mind
Oh! How for long disturbed my mind
A happy stirrup in my mind...
Nobody here can learn my mind,
Of Gallicisms I shall be fond
Or to her gestures can respond.
Oh, Vladimir! In the beyond,
Enjoys in peace the Great Beyond.
And never reading them had found
Left to the country, where she found
And tea is served; and I have found...
Flashed coldly and a victim found,
Is craving homage, and has found
The gang of beasts the girl has found.
The guesses shifted and they found
The generations make a round,
She is alone, no one around!
Then, sudd(e)nly stops, can’t look around,
Glanced at the stage and all around,
The lampions shine all around,
The noise and crush are all around.
The lofty chambers all around,
That was inscribed from top around
And glances of the maids around.
A mansion glitters on a ground.
By stern behavior they made ground
He drops the pistol on the ground,
Of nymphs, who make a nice background.
And by the sad burial ground,
Not sinless but a playful ground
Beware of books he had no ground
But insofar, I see no ground
On slippery and icy ground;
By this so meek and nice surround,
You’d better stay in safe surround.
Stands mute and vague in live surround,
Herself in Lord knows what surround.
Has chimed for Lensky by grave sound.
“My uncle used to be so sound,
Trustworthy friend, landowner sound,
Enough, my friend, for sake of God.
Here Dmitry Larin - slave of God,
“My darling, honestly to God!”
And she begins to squeak (my God!)
Eat beef-steaks and the Strasburg food
It rouses in my soul and blood!
The life was sparkling stirring blood.
Before a hand is stained with blood?
And when something had stirred his blood
Is paralyzed by lazy mood.
An old postilion with a beard
That is the master’s room and board,
Onegin opened one cupboard -
They sit and look at a chessboard
A gambler and a sergeant guard.
Onegin drives to boulevard,
The ladies started to move forward,
In spring, when stepping on greensward,
Impatient, frivolous and wayward.
The sheds and roofs, the fence and yard.
Looks very languishing and weird.
Besides they find that she’s weird,
But to the second, to the third
But managed only one accord,
And to repent I can’t afford
To press carved signet can’t afford.
He frowned, tried to play clavichord,
It’d happened that another landlord
A brigadier and fair landlord,
He was a straight and kind lord,
With deceased Lensky - neighbor lord.
What does he hear, my God, my Lord!
“Who could imagine? Oh, my Lord!
Has she discovered the true word?
The lively pictures or catchword,
I love so much this English word,
The mocking glances with no word
Here is his letter, word-to-word.
Since to Eugene she gave her word.
And reading them, a word by word,
Excelled and straight into the mud
For long, like through a misty cloud
The dogs attacked her barking loud.
And dames’ attire, smart and proud,
Of diplomats, who look so proud,
Istomina stands in a crowd
Mazurka entertains the crowd
But who is there in elite crowd,
She’s sliding through a shining crowd
The gilded youth by a thick crowd
And following a solemn crowd
Being a kid in children’s crowd
Just only you were and could be
I would be happy... as could be!
We could be happy, yes, could be.
As for the castles it should be...
Vladimir started to inscribe
I’ll be old-fashioned, yes, I’ll be.
As in the past she used to be.
And used to say... when would it be?”
“Isn’t she in love?” - Who can it be?
You know, my friend, how can it be...
All deeds are blessing, let it be,
In epigram it would work, maybe ...)
The holly water will help, maybe,
Oh! Can it happen? Yes, may be!
Five hundred years since now), maybe,
And they retained in calm and peace
Like this fool moon in calm and peace
Where I serenely bloomed in peace,
From storms escaped now lives in peace
“God, let his bones to rest in peace,
And strolling in the forests’ peace
For washing shoulders, breast and face...
What can you read on his pale face?
The moon is showing its pale face
On your like poppy burning face”.
Illuminates her doleful face;
Had covered her uncheerful face,
Onegin heard with a stern face
And watches people with stern face
Where he met Tanya face to face.
Where Fortune put us face to face,
The magic night and Luna’s face...
Declines his horns and sees his face,
Lukeria L’vovna whitens face,
But now, when looking at its face,
When it is blowing on my face
At bicorn new moon’s pretty face,
She never knew how to make lace,
But shortly changing of a place
She enters the abandoned place.
Exactly on the left hand place,
Do you remember this nice place,
My student’s cell at that nice place,
To see the world and change the place,
Now let us transfer to the place,
We think, you’re nice, since lamp replace.
The real learning they replace.
She hates to leave the native place.
And woody knolls of native place,
Nor beauties of a far off place,
Was a scenic and charming place;
Paris of all the local place,
She looked at it, the unknown place
By vision of a nice far place,
Have occupied on stage your place?
Have occupied on stage your place?
What is he doing at this place?
He looks like stranger at this place,
In Africa, my old folk’s place,
To put the friends at the right place.
As we have mentioned at right place,
In philosophic desert place,
She’s looking at an obscure space.
In solitude of rural space!
And in the midday’s wavy space -
And serf had blessed the divine grace.
Her smile and modest virgin grace
And started dashing headlong race
Showing the ill-disposed disgrace.
Which he excluded from disgrace...
But to admit it feels disgrace.
And now you search for my disgrace,
Leave in the air a charming trace,
The instant ballad’s long-term trace
No more night sorrow I can trace
Has disappeared like their light trace.
To pattern cloth with silky trace.
Seeds cabbage like Horace in Greece,
He reproved greats of Ancient Greece,
And a pineapple golden piece.
It’s like a mass of snow and ice
Two thin poles bonded by the ice
Their branches by decor of ice
Here is a roast beef’s bloodstained slice,
Gvozdin - a landlord fair and nice,
Onegin was quite fair and nice
Like you and I is fair and nice?
Like kiss of love is sweet and nice.
So, what? - “All right”. - You are so nice! -
And cuckold, who looks always nice,
And faintly whispered... isn’t it nice?
- At Larins. - “That looks pretty nice.
Tatiana listens to their voice,
To lose your face - that is the price...”
Approves this rational advice,
At least, remember my advice...
I call you to oppose the vice.
The couples flicker in the dance.
Invites her to cotillion dance.
Rusteroff, Olga calls to dance,
Gallop, mazurka, waltz, they dance.
And being satisfied by vengeance
Did not reiterate by chance
Here was a traveler - by chance
The over mature fiance,
That he’s Tatiana’s fiance.
Reanimate the heart reliance
She had forgotten bliss and brilliance
You know, Onegin, all this brilliance
By worthy of reproaching glance!
Though, in the past I used to glance
The aunties noticed this straight glance
I wish to cast at you my glance!
And his from fitting room appearance
A magic force arose remembrance,
Nor fell into poetic trance,
But it chimes ten and to the entrance
Here is my hero at the entrance,
A racing sleigh waits at the entrance,
The stead was full of the complaisance;
The posts show up white in a distance,
The pistols sparkled at a distance,
To get escape when at a distance
At nobly measured sound distance;
Allover silence, in the distance
And thank you, God, for the assistance,
I’ll be so thankful for assistance...
It’ll stop without my assistance.
To Olga since the adolescence,
But even in the adolescence
Was celebrated as love science.
The high society bright experience,
She is awaiting with impatience,
Again Onegin shows impatience
Onegin searched in great impatience
Or terminate the gloomy silence
I recognize its worthless essence
His eyes express an evil sentence,
You are alone and with persistence
He took off dress and with persistence,
And even nicer with persistence
As girlfriend of my sad existence,
The sentries’ calls recalled existence;
But he cooled off routine existence.
This minute-long gushing existence.
So far, do revel your existence
A hunter threats to its existence.
Of what no one distrusts long since,
And pushed Tatiana both at once,
Will animate my soul at once!
I'm waiting you: so, do, at once,
And all what pleased my heart at once
In paper cap, exclaimed not once
Onegin met him, and not once
Your best friend with a smile not once
Over the lexicon not once.
(Who badly treated was not once),
Like sapling changes leaves not once,
There’s none, just remains of the fierce...
Obtained in turn without fierce,
And drives a doggy at full force;
She with her husband didn’t divorce.
And rainbow on the snow induce.
When it avails a simple produce.
The life is seeking to produce,
Since for the first time introduce
I shall in detail introduce.
And chases after her like shade;
Where now the cross and branches’ shade
The places, where the bloody shade
And, maybe, his unhappy shade
To recollect pipe, mask and blade,
When five more steps they both had made,
Of the neat items Europe made.
That marriage settlement was made,
To them a great discount made...
They shovel silver by a spade;
Replace this trash and masquerade,
He could achieve a supreme grade.
The price of love by that upgrade.
And looking serious persuade
His grandpa’s wealth to deuce confide.
The poet now is dead, his bride
He gets on, and they start the ride
Triumphing victories and pride,
Like Byron, poet of the pride,
I wondered at their haughty pride,
To watch the murmur of seaside,
He leaves pool room, puts cue aside,
And do not make a step aside!
Babushka says... ”Here’s a fireside,
Arranges table at fireside.
The ladies sit by fireside,
A madrigal at the graveside.
It’d covered all the countryside,
Let them the heirloom to divide
A cause for gossip did provide.
Through mannered crowd of beau monde,
And finally had seen beau monde.
At flatness of the femme du monde,
Averted, yawned and did conclude...
Though, play or pranks I can’t exclude,
Let’s talk of old times and of thee”.
Interpret what is worth of thee,
The waves did drop at feet of thee!
Slender and long like waist of thee...
Of right appointment with thee;
“Who loves you more than I do thee
“And who is she?” She’s Larins, nee. -
It’s time, it’s time! - I want be free!
So lively, cheerful and carefree,
But, maybe, all that is worth free
But at same time, you should agree,
He drained the bottles, two or three.
It was hanged up on a pine tree
The only one, whom I would see
I’m close to stop it, let me see.
Now, it is ready, can we see,
She’s in confusion... “Shall I see
“So, you are married! I can see!
His son just married." - I can see... -
It’s nice, my friend, when you can see
I’m giddy, nanny, you can see...
Who is Tatiana’s addressee?
I was thirteen years old, you see,
I'm shuddering in rage, you see ;
Then, Roosteroff - the same, you see.
They whisper... “Dunya, do you see!"
With Nina Vronsky, who, you see,
The boredom of unmarried life
Is proud of his style of life,
A handsome in the prime of life,
In quilted robe the rest of life
For long you’ve slighted the high life! -
And it will chase him all his life,
About passed and current life,
Please come to me and share my life!..”
And will be faithful all my life”.
Who shared with him the happy life.
To other man I am a wife
My cordial friend, my beloved wife,
And pleasantness of a nice wife.
Like shadow or a faithful wife.
By children and his faithful wife,
A family, where a poor wife
His copious dinner and his wife.
Would be a cuckold at his wife.
By a good willed and sinless wife
So far as for his pleasant wife,
“But who is she?” - She is my wife. -
They took a seat, the honored carriage
From ball to bed he’s moved by carriage.
Give the advice... it’s time for marriage!...
With children of the plural age
Since that time, when Tatiana’s image
Has same boyfriend Monsieur Lepage,
And Lensky properly enrage.
Remains in vaunted grandpas’ age...
Where everyone feels free and sage
The Beastoffs couple, gray and sage,
The well-known youthful theatre sage
The fortune law is always sage.
I know that God, who’s always sage,
The life of real ancient sage,
It’s dinner time for country sage!
To hiss an actor off the stage,
And honored dweller of backstage,
But that’s enough to relish ravage.
Since all my life was just a pledge
The troika roans have pulled the sledge.
Don’t blame and do not find strange!
That Lensky sent Onegin challenge,
And vowed that he will take revenge
Two pines by roots together merge,
Farewell to solitary refuge!
And think... Oh gosh, when will you die!”
The fruits of learning, truth and lie?
Here’s boredom, there is fraud or lie,
Reveillez-vous, belle endormie.
Five miles away from Krasnogorie
We’ll move the mountains and tie
At oversweeten tea and sweetie,
The sighs, and tedium, and fake.
(Denying prejudice as fake)
I stroll by a deserted lake
She flashed across and at the lake
But no decision she can make.
All settled. Thus a plan they make...
He starts to frown - they make a brake.
By breakfast, dinner and tea brake;
To suffer for the money sake
She is afraid a breath to take,
“Good morning, darling, time to wake!
And domesticity don’t like,
Accompanied by French Trike -
Is engaged by Tambov’s Trike,
And Lensky can’t withstand the stroke.
She’s like Madonna by Van-Dyke,
At night starts singing in the dale.
Sings songs of love in a calm dale.
The flocks make noise, a nightingale
It is a place, where nightingale
Pine forest, shadow, tempest, gale,
He walks in looking like dead pale,
The atmosphere is languid, pale,
And also skinny and too pale,
Her face didn’t neither blush nor pale...
She does not sleep, her face turns pale.
Who is like morning moonlight pale
Sometimes I’ll finish my true tale
A sentimental moral tale,
Tried to perceive the youngster's tale..
In the beginning of my tale
Do love the hero of my tale,
To rise the sun from morning vale,
They cry and noise like in a fable.
In winter time, here, he shared table
The beasts are sitting at the table;
And being pleased by festive table
Who comes to share my boring table,
A waxen jug was placed on table -
Irregular and careless babble,
With housekeeper used to ramble,
When the environment did tremble,
Tatiana blushed, began to tremble.
As before stir my heart to tremble,
The sounds of a cab wheel rumble
To whom your vice is not a trouble?
A driving horse has scented trouble
But here I see another trouble...
- I do not see here any trouble.
Has she interpreted this riddle?
Didn’t ever touch a sewing needle,
And then, anew, as always idle
Jokes impregnated with the bile
The former friends are full of bile,
To follow love and in a while
And leave Tatiana for a while,
The talks are postponed for a while;
She’ll chat and hush then for a while.
“Enough, please, listen for a while.
They sit together for a while,
The lips are adorned with a smile;
The world received her with a smile;
In all the guests evoking smile
The flaxen curls and tender smile,
And to arose the ladies smile
Thus, Lensky’s speech evoked his smile.
When you are old, life is so vile...”
When he remained in self exile,
What is he after self-exile?
The skeptical essays by Belle,
Philosophy by Fontenelle,
Or any other bagatelle
Without all that bagatelle,
How well Tatiana played the role
And play this miserable role,
In jest prepares to play her role
In the old cap and camisole.
To reconcile them, then for triple
And hiding far away from people
Pipes’ amber from Constantinople,
In a front room it’s crush and bustle,
Barking of pugs, noise, laughter, hustle,
And more than that, once in a battle
To mourn, to laugh, to title tattle
And Flyanov, being not fine fettle,
He tried in rush with foe to settle,
And my Tatiana, little by little,
Spill with Champaign straight from a bottle,
Insulted you over a bottle
Perfume in stylish cut-glass bottle
And though he loved the life to throttle,
He used sometimes to ridicule
Depicting modern world and style,
And biting epigrams’ harsh style.
By sudden epigrams’ brisk style.
And tinsel of the fashion style,
Here - lack of conscious, there - poor style,
That my, besides all that, poor style
There is no life in Olga’s style.
Inspired gaze and mind’s style,
One with the horns and doggy muzzle,
Here something making just a puzzle,
She was awaiting... and he came.
You’ve given up your life and fame.
Be a mean slave of sense and fame?
Away from vanity and fame,
Or even Demon, whom I fame.
His evil courage brought him fame,
The stately wigs' and red heels' fame
But I shall bring to it new fame
The race-and-catch or other game
Tatiana felt unreasoned shame
Whose mind is above fake shame.
And I confess to you with shame
Like hearing someone’s spiteful blame.
Nor by poetic charming flame,
What distance is from ice to flame,
Tatiana burns in feeling’s flame,
And being shocked like burned by flame
Again young lover burned by flame
Did stir the youthful breast by flame,
And, pensively, the cherished name
Seeing my portrait, reading name
Vladimir Lensky was his name,
Tatiana was her sister’s name...
He should not mention there my name! -
Who for the ladies make a frame.
Of love, of Olga, all the same!
Oh, people, you are all the same,
Are all like that, and he’s the same;
Even the slander is the same.
All lots to me looked just the same.
The first success encouraged me;
And all his youth he hallowed me!
And shall return to him, believe me,
Would you pour tears, and think of me,
Sends you take custody of me…
To quench by pray grieve burning me?
Another fate is waiting me…
Onegin was prepared with me
In silence you conversed with me,
If you could still remain with me,
Open the window, sit with me”.
Arousing love for them is crime,
What were his beliefs in the prime?
Mazurka still is in the prime,
Had seized him little at a time.
With young Venetian spend time.
He dreams of Olga all the time.
She's keeping silent all the time.
Or Idol mio, and same time
You’ll fell in love again. Same time...
Forgotten words; and at same time
She mustn't miss him; but, same time...
For fortune telling its prime time.
At that night period of time,
How’s frisky Olga spending time?”
It is the same, the passing time
And where’s her sister passing time?
Was waiting there for a long time.
Please, bless the job I do long time,
Oh, Vladimir! Not for long time
(No doubt) will take too much time,
She woke up at a usual time
Was interrupted time to time
I am diluting time to time
Read in oblivion time to time
We greet the pranks of wintertime.
But in the frosty winter time
In such a boredom kill your time?”
The welcome hand and share pastime.
About what they talk this time?
Like a sad hermit spent his time,
He is remembering that time,
He’s blessed... But, maybe, at that time
Began to aim, but at that time
It’s quite correct... at that right time
The customs of the ancient time,
By wise discussions of past time
Like used to be in the best time,
And calm, and solitary time.
And Vanya younger was than me.
What envy was aroused in me,
The winter finally has come,
The lamps of night on magic dome
To visit this deserted dome,
She was again in the same dome,
Patrols the remote heavens’ dome;
After return to hearth and home,
She glorified my hearth and home
And in the parents’ native home
The pilgrim should now leave back home.
Tatiana to the yard from home
Tatiana shortly left for home.
Fell silent in the Larins’ home.
Found himself at neighbors’ home.
Tatiana enters empty home,
Vladimir being rich and handsome
He looks at him and calls... It’s awesome...
You’d be a pledge of good to me,
It makes a sacred thing to me,
But you’re not listening to me... -
Her nice in-quarto hands to me,
Zizi, do you remember me?
But me... why should it bother me?
Should attempt writing after me”.
Intended Olga he for me,
But that’s enough. It’s time for me
I’d ask you for a favor, for me
Cowberry water troubles me,
Or flying by it will pass me?
How he, like foolish, cries... it’s me!
He is not here, no one knows me
This Eve he came to visit me.
The roads are flat like is a rhyme
Doesn’t dare to trouble by a rhyme,
Not to forget of whom I rhyme...
The extracts from a northern rhyme,
As a keepsake they used to rhyme,
He was quite close the words to rhyme.
She feels indifferent to rhyme?
And on a silver water pane
Was breathing on a chilly pane
Then, country home, chilled glassy pane,
That he was very nice and sane.
To become hardened and to wane
I won’t let flower to wane,
Nor a wise truth or a nice scene
Inspiring moon illumed the scene.
In front of it a lovely scene...
It is excusable. Eugene,
Both sisters brings to my Eugene,
As was described by Lafontaine...
Extend, then brief and then combine.
I’m free again, want to combine
Composed by Virgil or Racine,
Tatiana looks quite free and fine.
Enough, my darling... They are fine
In modern fashion, looking fine;
The Christmastide has come. All fine!
With you take bath and feel so fine!
She feels quite happy, she is fine.
She looks around - all is fine.
The frost did sparkle. It is fine,
Depicts by pen and colors fine;
As between wolf and dog). That’s fine.
No one of these I can imagine
The prophecies you can’t imagine,
By the new world’s uproar and shine
In Moscow many beauties shine.
In the twilight of candles’ shine.
My fancy house and this shine
The frozen panes of windows shine
The years the playful rhyme decline,
The years to severe prose incline,
The other one - the bottles line,
So far as for the friend of mine,
Hurrah, Bordeaux, best friend of mine!
About dogs and kin of mine.
She dreams she is a heroine
Or didn’t grieve much and stopped to pine?
The woe had passed, she stopped to pine
Their issue follows same routine...
Alas! It’s easy to divine!
Drinks from a tumbler just red wine;
Got rid of humid cork, and wine
The dishes clatter and the wine
And friendly goblet of the wine
A row of jugs with apple wine,
A bottle of a nice white wine,
About haying, taste of wine,
And drink Bordeaux - a prudent wine.
Yet, wasn’t it Ladies Magazine,
Did try to blame them for the done...
Let me acquaint you with the one...
The stranger tongue into home one?
(The date reminds when he’d gone)
The altar’s sacred flame has gone!
Will never come again, has gone,
He answered - Nothing. - And was gone.
Regret for past and for bygone;
Where my tale’s hero dwelled alone.
Decided to stay home alone;
She’s dreaming that she’s quite alone,
Can you imagine, I’m alone,
And when at last she was alone,
When rides headlong in fields alone
When in a corner sat alone.
A dame is coming, not alone,
You shall not leave my heart alone.
To read here books and stay alone.
Belongs to other one and no one
Appeared together, and no one
(Please, note the chapter number one)
It’s time to match the elder one,
He led her to the altar’s throne.
Who inspirers your poetic tone,
She had retained her look and tone,
At high society men’s wrong tone,
It’s Hymen’s bonds and monotone,
There is inscription on the stone,
Please, stay in piece under the stone!”
The country view and sad gravestone,
But nowadays, the sad gravestone
And see a lonely sad gravestone,
Uses to stop at the gravestone.
His neighbor’s sorrowful gravestone,
There you can hear the brook's sweet tone
The milestones switch just one by one
And Terpsichore is only one,
What can I do, when everyone,
But which of these had made a fortune,
That there are chosen by the fortune
Who is destined to her by fortune...
Lord Byron thanks to lucky fortune
It's nice to rage embarrassed foe
And obscured neighborhood landscape,
“Farewell to peaceable landscape!
On a park bench obtained escape.
To thunder, capture and escape.
To guess appropriate escape,
Disturbed him giving no escape.
It is more tender than of pipe...
The virgin moan of dreaming pipe.
But all the same, to them the hope
But sometimes distant signs of hope
Feel jealousy and harbor hope,
To follow her and cherishes hope;
The groves were getting dull and bare.
By aunts’ and mothers’ watch and care
Caress and take of them good care,
His soul was warmed up by the care
They won’t disturb you. Yes, take care!
Are always welcomed with much care
A person should be slain with care
At that time I preferred to care.
But was not smart enough to care.
Have you forgotten all your care?
And I am grateful for your care.
From porch to yard she rushed in scare,
She didn’t know what to do in scare;
Whom she adores, who causes scare!
But he is sleeping and doesn’t care.
She does not see, or does not care,
And of the damsel took best care.
Just being charmed by friendly care,
Appeared Katenin and did dare
To be a poet he didn’t dare,
But to believe I did not dare,
She flied, to turn back did not dare.
To glance at him she does not dare;
How long ago they used to share
She wished her life with him to share,
Her cheeks and neck like roses flare.
Tatiana ah! What a night mare!
Ragtag and bobtail, that’s nightmare...”
A case with pistols to prepare
If he could at that time compare
And under her angelic stare
And of the duel be aware.
Would ever she had been aware
Bronze on the table, chinaware,
He dashed to chef Talon aware
Onegin shortly was aware
Tatiana’s nanny was aware,
With whom you dared to be sincere,
With Tanya, who was too sincere.
- How long ago he was dropped here?
“Vladimir Lensky rests in here,
I give my definition here...
Tatiana’s husband enters. Here
The alley to the lake and there
The villages dropped here and there,
 “A lot of people will be there,
Kaverin was awaiting there.
A stranger reads inscription there...
The sun is rising over there,
But who is sitting over there,
But a grand general right there
With young Semenova; just there
The solitude is so severe,
He was the duels doctrinaire
Dropped shoe or book into the fire.
Extinguished ash will not make fire,
The fishers kindled smoking fire.
Was heating it by virgin fire.
The sacred poetry delire
Whom I remember and admire,
Are either despondent Vampire
And who with no wine could inspire!
Could change his soul, the same desire
And now the objects for desire
Though, wedding was against desire,
And thanks to that I shall acquire
- You just the solemn odes require!
Ballets awake in me just bore,
Her suitor, whom she didn’t adore,
She did not notice them before,
More than you used to do before. -
Doesn’t breathe the frost air as before,
You’ll perish, darling, but before
The virtue is not gloried more.
Whom she preferred and adored more.
Her view disturbed him more and more.
By Olga’s merits more and more
And burn and burn just more and more...
But mind sought for something more;
They are just stupid, nothing more,
A stall, a fence and nothing more.
Just parody and nothing more?
I cannot handle Ai more,
And she has no force to run more.
The dusk thins out, but no more
Since I am not a sinner more.
She does not greet the winter more,
Takes a full hour or more.
It’s nice to see that he doesn’t more
You should not chase me anymore.
Didlo doesn’t stir me anymore”.
And did not stir him anymore.
I can’t withstand it anymore
The grassland, bridges and parterre,
Inside and out of the theatre
Onegin speeded to the theatre,
Promises to her something obscure.
His weary soul has now to endure!
Or other literature figure
And on the right a puzzling figure -
And where is this ambiguous figure,
Besides, they are so chaste and pure,
Ah, darling, Olga is so pure!
“But I was born not for a pleasure;
But being worn by night time pleasure,
Were soft exciting lavish pleasure.
Tatiana views all that with pleasure,
(Not for too many it makes pleasure
And he was seized by a displeasure,
The wrath of love and of lust pleasure
And loves himself beyond all measure.
She had unveiled a secret measure
That in two weeks he’ll earn the treasure -
Abandoned house looks like treasure,
Into his cloak, like dreadful treasure,
The land of fathers, freedoms’ treasure!
To whom himself makes only treasure,
So switching business time and leisure
The kid of luxury and leisure
It's noble..." Here I could, for sure,
Is killed by friendly hand, for sure!
He’s honest fellow, that’s for sure”.
Tatiana (purely Russian creature,
But then, obedient to the nature,
And did not rush against the nature.
Farewell to you the joyful nature,
Should I by family nice picture
He searched for them without rapture,
Who chilled his love by a departure,
“I'll save her from the evil torture,
Who never suffered jealous torture,
Good bye my freedom, coming future
Drops lather, thrashes like in seizure,
A little pigeon on a lyre
But she, whom my poetic lyre
The love’s and Petrarch’s tongue and lyre.
He wandered in the world with lyre
Recalling the great Petrarch’s lyre,
I’d better still my chatty lyre.
Then put them back into the case.
Flied up the marble steps of staircase
Pour on like rain and never cease.
It’s doing that and does not cease.
Though, sometimes used to praise and please.
I do love her, excuse me please!
“How are you? Fine, then, tell me please,
And grant his soul salvation, please!”
Tatiana, dear, come closer, please,
Beforehand yawning in post-chase,
Pronounce common banal phrase
All disappears like empty phrase,
Between a slice of Limburg cheese
Poor Tanya could not withstand these.
But Olga was not fond of these.
Just Tanya isn’t among of these.
I can’t just count all of these”.
And fluid vividness of these
He had experienced lots of these.
And execrates long stay of these.
The fate has counted all these,
And I confess escaped from these,
And redcurrants besides these.
The other lines, and just by these
By long drive carriage or post-chaise,
Onegin was the first to raise
I live and write not for a praise,
Thus, highland virgin I did praise,
Just mediocrity we praise,
Or maiden’s letters worth of praise.
Inestimable sensual praise,
The anthem, which the Lord does praise.
They in the parlor exercise
I shouldn’t digressions exercise.
Seductive talent exercise
She hears the strangers’ cries and noise.
She didn’t enjoy the loud noise,
Still jump all over and make noise.
Is skating on the ice with noise;
Booths, peasants, sledges, city noise,
Of course, his words should cause despise,
And do you not at all despise
And cheery like a morning rise,
She gets up with a morning rise
By crimson beams of the sunrise.
When saw him coming with sunrise.
All causes rapture and surprise.
Grant to me even more surprise!
The same amaze she could not rise
The elevated expertise...
Disdains, subjects to expertise,
Please, listen to me and be wise,
Brought with a bunch of other wise
Doing it straight or otherwise.
Or mail them postcards otherwise
My mother-in-law otherwise
Were even worse and much less wise.
That despite all his witty wise
Watching Tatiana, no one else,
Began to think of something else.
He’s deaf and mute, and nothing else.
But of myself and nothing else.
In the dark glass, and nothing else.
Just airs and graces, nothing else,
What is it, vanity or else?
Purpose of ode makes high expense,
At least a chip of feel and sense.
By lulling of the thoughts and sense.
Checks for the words complied with sense...
The rhymes are full of loving nonsense,
The naive talks and other nonsense
(Like dream of love or other nonsense)
Its idle purpose makes no sense.
To drive the trade, and that makes sense,
A worthless phantom with pretense,
At home awaiting for response,
He could not give a right response.
He hardly gives the right response;
Love, idleness - I adore those!
The bushes, chutes and all of those
The bear announced... stay with those,
Nothing could differ more than those!
I by myself belong to those.
Is still of interest to those,
What artful nets he spread for those!
The last departure day is close.
And if I have a chance to choose,
Since people need to have repose;
But now it’s not right thing to purpose,
Like Moon her beauty does expose.
Thus, you can judge, what bunch of rose
(Here you expect a rhyme with rose;
And searching for a rhyme in verse
The Novel in Verse
He pulls a sled like is a horse
A cab to stand is pulled by horse,
But then to make it even worse.
Who fight for heirloom, spite and curse.
Onegin left for home, of course.
Not only my Eugen of course
You were in love, sometimes, of course.”
I can’t forget him, yes, of course! -
A formal answer... yes, of course.
He’ll manage all of it, of course.
They lay above the fatal fosse.
Annoying to me, then, did cause
I cannot judge of those because
Told her of that, and just because
The former friends, who despise cause,
Your cold response and sense abuse
I shall request for your excuse...
To conquer us and to amuse,
And drew my lively frisky Muse
You will be followed by my Muse
It's to the lady of the house
By a young lady of the house,
She still receives him at her house,
Oh, you, an honorable spouse!
And the same spitz and the same spouse,
He was caressed by cunning spouse -
Would be a husband’s faithful spouse.
Accompanied by portly spouse
Another former spring arouse,
He’d fallen into half a drowse;
Then, coffee drank and in a drowse
Watching a dream, he’s in a drowse,
Here were old ladies in a drowse,
By blizzard snowed stay in a drowse.
In midst of the poetic drowse,
Conceived for all these dreams and drowse.
A shepherd horn broke in the drowse,
Just after leaving morning drowse
Right on the fur coats are in drowse.
And Lensky wandering in drowse
She hurries to communicate.
Was cared as bridegroom candidate,
The priests and neighbors drank and ate,
Make friends with her, invite to date,
I can’t get and my soul update...
Will not be lost in later date;
Onegin shot... The clock of fate
This so much awful cruel fate?
And by attempting evil fate
They will resolve the poet’s fate.
He’s perished. The young poet’s fate
And being cared by lucky fate
Is creeping sliding off the gate.
Now we are passing Tverskoy gate.
To clash two centuries I hate.
Tatiana’s letter to translate.
But do not know how to translate,
Who wouldn’t be bored to simulate,
But summer comes to very late.
Search for a daughter a good mate.
He, whom I sing, is a good mate,
The drowsy heart reanimate,
My lonely nook, please, animate,
And let my Muse to animate...
The songs, which are intimate,
They rush to sparkle and to mate,
The jealous man can celebrate,
You’d gain the tempting high life rate?
Where sermons they reiterate,
And scarcely will deserve high rate.
By dreams she used to decorate
Give kisses, touch the arms and prate,
Where against me today they prate,
To all her folks to demonstrate
A reformation in estate.
To widow Larina’s estate
The old ones look quite obsolete,
You are exhausted, let’s complete.
But with his soul at tete-a-tete
Was changed by overall excite.
And nothing can her soul excite.
Follow my muse with less excite.
And spring doesn’t please it, doesn’t excite?
With a coarse salt of public spite
Not by affection, nor by spite,
As pushed by the ancestral rite,
It is a kin of Russian rite,
Retained in common people’s rite,
And Russian N in French did write;
That a self-portrait I did write,
The strophes and rhymes, which now I write,
And thus, in French she used to write.
Guillot drew back to a safe site
To move the horses to safe site.
She dared to leave the hiding site,
Came visit the burial site.
Please leave the city’s restless site,
For handing letters perfect site.
There is no road in thicket site,
And later in a lonely site
A fortune telling lonely site.
For nothing tease your appetite,
Affect Tatiana; yet, it’s quite
An obscured something in remote.
From god forsaken far remote
Of feasts in capital’s remote,
In deaf eternity remote
And that by jealousy promote;
Who to him sometimes wrote a note;
He used to highlight and denote?
And not a speck of ink, do note.
Please, send your grandson with this note. -
- Then send your grandson with this note
Don’t want to read? - Then, prices quote,
There, being in a panic haste
To love and feels its real taste.
To his attires in last taste
All what in Paris hungry taste
She drops a handkerchief; to waste
And signet t. a v. Annette;
A heart of regular coquette!
Is she a baby or coquette?
Yes, your sincerity is cute,
She startled slightly, staying mute
It stirred my heart for so long mute,
And all the way she wasn’t mute,
To maintain spouse and father’s due,
Look at the life as at a queue
Zaretsky held his scathing tongue
And she preferred illusions’ tongue
When I can... - “Here, again eclogue!
Latin today is not high value,
Where a dull husband knows her value,
For happy dates a lovely venue;
And you, my Idol, fair and true,
- Goodbye, Onegin, time to leave.
Spread over my poor nanny’s grave...
Makes noise and splashes by the wave
From prose to verse, from rock to wave?
Where do you plan to spend the eve?”
Let him, so far, in that believe
At heart an ignorant naive,
I should new character conceive...
Maybe, you just can not perceive
And now, in chapter number five
And when in parlor clock chimes five,
Gave up for three and point five!
A bee from waxen cell of hive
And with that faith in life still live;
(The Lensky’s village) used to live,
And hire a carriage for a drive.
Can not the avid lips deprive
His gaze was wonderfully pensive;
But it was really expressive,
Not free of efforts and submissive
- But why are you so negative,
And how a human can survive,
Which in the days I told above
I shall start now, though all above
But you, the beauty all above,
We all get habit from above,
And beauty of the sky above,
The words of melancholic love,
And it replaces good and love.
With enmity, and hope, and love,
The time had come, she fell in love.
Like a teenager fell in love;
She was with Richardson in love.
A poet, and with Kant in love.
And you, the forests I do love,
Will get used to and stop to love;
Of sacred spring, the time for love!
How could give up himself for love!
Again this anguish and this love!
Would you, sometimes, esteem my love?
How did you pay me for my love?
By picture of a happy love
I beg, my newborn creature, move
And what was it in snowdrift’s groove?
I say to my Onegin bye.
Vladimir screwing up left eye
To simulate cold speech and gaze,
And she perceived his obscure gaze
Casts at Tatiana a stiff gaze,
Noise in the ears, the burning gaze ...
She followed them by doleful gaze...
And then with puzzle in her gaze
Your cold reprimand and your gaze.
It presages to covert gaze
It’s hidden in the obscure haze.
The cheeks start instantly to blaze,
And their creative Muses’ blaze
It made me proud to amaze
Had brought his soul into amaze.
But, probably, want to amaze
Who drew me to a great amaze,
It happened that an early breeze
The chairs are moved and in a squeeze
Disturb my heart... I realize
By your neglection penalize.
Whom did your verses idolize?”
I greet the one who’ll recognize
Could never ever recognize.
And other books didn’t recognize.
By sweet caress had made a prize
Could not by same attraction prize.
I used to play with his war prize -
The thirst for glory and for prize,
Examined, fixed and cleaned from doze.
The biting frost the nature froze,
Tatiana tries to analyze
And with a swagger analyze
Craved for a fatal heart relief;
Stirred by a bliss and by a grief
Embraced by mad regret and grief
And hand to me a rightful staff,
And with her husband she slipped off...
Commands from elegy take off
What bliss her breast is breathing off!
Onegin now is getting off,
Has arrived stout Triflyakoff,
Is snoring heavy Triflyakoff
A sash of silk the girl took off;
Here’s family of Pygmykoff
My uncle’s son Mr. Ruffianoff
And ex-advisor Mr. Flyanoff -
That sucks the flower’s sap off;
Then, local dandy Roosteroff,
Ruffianoff, Gvozdin, Rusteroff
The flocks of darks from banks fly off.
But suddenly a wind did puff,
Onegin pushes off the stuff.
He can not think of other stuff.
The basins, pots, and all that stuff,
And leaning on a granite shelf
As Poet had portrayed himself.
And hands to her his pearl himself.
I'll now explain it by myself,
I wonder what she’s dreaming of.
Your severe look will find proof
Thus, I foresee irate reproof.
French cuisine the highest proof,
It purrs and washes snout by leg...
When choosing clothing was a prig
I wish you’d burned by thunder bang!
He drinks - the same does all the gang,
And at your feet burst out sobbing,
And to me like Bacchante facing
And bends to her with ardor glancing,
And what? His eyes continued reading,
The walks, deep sleep, relax and reading,
And on the last one you are reading...
Onegin did not like much reading,
A letter in her hands, she’s reading,
Not thanks to his great novels reading
In lonely indoors enjoy reading,
The night time shades have started fading,
Alas, Tatiana now is fading,
Onegin stands like specter shading.
“But tell me, nanny, how’s your wedding?”
He’s brought the orchestra, no kidding!
I’ll be Napoleon, no kidding;
Present me to her”. - Are you kidding?
Without diligence succeeding
While she is graciously proceeding
Doesn’t push the cows from shed for feeding,
Can you divine, where’s Eugene speeding?
We, thanks to God, can flash with breeding,
In a side street a stead is hiding,
From a hill’s slope is slowly sliding.
It’s getting dark, he went sleigh riding,
Tatiana at the window standing
By charming finger was amending...
I’m giving you this bail intending
I stroll by sea shore weather minding
All what my soul to fit affording.
To sign the letter not affording
Oh, is there somewhere such a being
To face an academic being
And thus, I switched to a strange being ...
Beyond the threshold of the being
But, maybe, for the world’s well-being,
I was conceived for peaceful being,
To sigh of gloomy Russian being,
The purpose of the human being.
Dreams, wishes, grieves of human being
And any other human being,
Enjoyed this careless languor being,
With open heart, like poet’s being,
“Should I want to confine my being
All stuff that he is hearing, seeing
Sometimes a youthful guy he’s seeing,
There, in a late sleep he is seeing
It serves me right, he thought when judging
Her reading fluent eyes are fogging.
His silenced lyre if not stopped singing
These are away, those beyond reaching,
I knew the beauties beyond reaching,
Goddess of mystery and sighing.
The hall is full, the boxes flashing,
She looks around holding breathing,
Since hears behind the bear’s breathing;
And by the well-disposed night’s breathing
She’s suffocating, heavy breathing;
And Lensky in his mind seething
And do imagine one same thing -
That you’ve betrayed the youth and something
(And, thus, reminds me something).
The misses frisk expecting something.
He slides with her and whispers something,
And so far in a morning clothing,
Is coming out in light clothing,
It’s sad to think that just for nothing
When naughty boy detains poor thing,
She fails to find anything
And wasn’t it you, whom I heard speaking,
I just do need after long speaking
Completing evil undertaking
Of a sly person’s undertaking,
He takes an ice bath after waking,
And at the door furtively flicking.
With no coarse subjects or nitpicking.
Dispensing alms or when was seeking
Her heart is trembling, she is seeking
Where she’s a subject of a talking.
With Spain Ambassador now talking?”
The prince replied with Eugene walking...
She is returning home by walking,
And wasn’t it you, of whom was thinking
The music play, the candles blinking,
But let it be, your care revealing
She started shivering and paling.
Onegin is morbidly paling -
Is used to go somewhere for gambling.
At home he sleeps without trembling;
Provoked the silenced feels resembling;
Or since she loves with no dissembling
Confess like you with no dissembling,
Her blossom, health and vivid feeling,
Who could not recognize the feeling
Yet, not the girl stirred by the feeling,
Began to walk restraining feeling,
What can stir up such a strong feeling?
And being stirred by languish feeling
What a sweet heartache I am feeling!
The reckless adoration feeling
The poet sleeps and has no feeling,
One and the same familiar feeling,
To Lovelace hiding secret feeling.
With soul embraced by sorrow feeling
With waves I was embraced by feeling,
His lazy soul is moved by feeling...
They didn’t excel neither by feeling,
Meanwhile, her soul was hit by feeling,
- And what? - “Not she would stir my feeling,
By worthy of your lofty feeling
Making it’s quiet magic sailing
Again the fantasy is boiling,
And watches how the snow is piling,
And looks more neat than parquet tiling.
Door opens; who’s there? Olga calling;
Was watching how the snow was falling.
- I think it was what God was telling.
The landlord solitary dwelling
Thus, he had left his country dwelling,
Poured by the Olga’s hand was filling
And Tanya’s charming youth is chilling...
Spring resurrection causes thrilling
And it produces my heart thrilling
The Lensky’s fate against the willing
To touch cute legs my lips were willing!
It happened that the nobles willing...”
And should it be my fortune’s willing
And in the open air keeps strolling
“I can’t sleep... stifling... nanny, darling!
To others’ rebel passions whirling.
The girls are at Tatiana hustling;
Starts singing falsely. Splashes, screaming
Or, maybe, in the mind dreaming,
Being immersed into the dreaming
And finally in bed while dreaming
Wherever, always the same dreaming,
Onegin stood immersed in dreaming
The tongue by which the girl was dreaming
She is disturbed by her night dreaming.
He entertained his soul by dreaming
On melting snow he’s quietly dreaming
His life in calm and peace was streaming...
The fragrant tea by dark jet streaming
Than let someone his name defaming,
Being afraid of jealous blaming,
Since young enkindled his soul flaming.
Her heart by bitter torment flaming
And started like a pilgrim roaming
Would ever I hear freedom chiming?
I saw the sea before storm coming...
All clapping. Here’s Onegin coming,
And when the country night is coming,
And were engaged in song performing.
What is this fearful dreaming meaning?
From calaboose to forest greening,
Here is my friend, have a good evening!
But my Onegin spent the evening
Sometimes, before the coming evening
And his lorgnette aside aligning
She sighs and to herself assigning
While cheerful look at you remaining!
The yawning by the laugh restraining...
And made a bow without straining.
Gnawed by a flip success obtaining,
Not for the high life entertaining,
All that didn’t look so entertaining;
Nothing can make her entertaining,
It’s getting dark. The sky stopped shining.
It’s getting dark; on table shining
With sparkles at the bright sun shining
By which his stormy time was shining;
And at that time the moon was shining
With frosty silver dust was shining
The Luna in the sky is shining,
That’s how a butterfly is shining
By languor light illumining
About Olga he is limning,
(Of whom I told in the beginning),
And, as I told in the beginning,
A maid in hut a thread is spinning;
On which the modern world is spinning!
The pretty subjects, to whom sinning
On a snowed road a boy is running.
When after speedy heady running
Tatiana wakened in the morning
I must be sure in the morning
He waked up early in the morning,
She does not notice coming morning,
What’s planning to me coming morning?
She’s worth of this amazing morning,
But in the next day’s early morning
I was astonished, I was burning,
Who was so frank, whose soul was burning;
Again this touch of leg is burning,
An olden crippled man is turning
A mirror to the moon is turning.
She loved to greet the coming dawning,
Through dream is greeting the year dawning;
And Olga too had started yawning,
- Well, well, Onegin, you are yawning. -
She thinks... “What is now Olga doing?
My goddesses! How are you doing?
My goddesses! How are you doing?
The lazy East for long is sleeping,
He has no chance for duel skipping,
He feels so happy when he’s slipping
A shade of night is calmly slipping,
That friends would prefer shackles bearing
Stands up adopting pompous bearing,
He demonstrated perfect bearing...
The more in thickets, better hearing
How doleful looks to me appearing
But thud of horses' hoofs appearing
The guests are coming. And when staring
Will organize a trap and bring
The innocence can trouble bring”.
The ancestors to coffins bring.
Completely to her love surrendering,
You, epic Muse I am admiring!
A note to one whom is admiring.
These are dead treasures you’re inspiring!
The round dances were expiring.
Enough, no bonds and no more tiring!
The river shines in ice attiring
- Yes, you are right indeed requiring
Like all the other things turned boring;
Cotillion was so long and boring,
- “A habit, Lensky”. - You are boring
In country wilderness you’re boring,
- What’s with you, Tanya? - “I am boring,
The country, where Eugene was boring,
Whose feeling he was just ignoring;
It sparkles like a sacred spring
Tatiana murmurs at the spring
And what a languishing blessed stirring
Gets in... and what a thrill he’s stirring...
And he was Benedetta purring
To his fair lady, nice and pleasing!
He writes response polite and pleasing.
The poet, who is great and pleasing,
The elements to me unpleasing,
Was after her like crazy chasing.
To sing the steppe that she was praising.
By fireside spleen exercising.
He stopped his talent exercising,
The golden autumn is arising.
But finally, before sunrising
Her look is languishing and blessing!
The nature with a smile arousing
To remain silent when debating,
Get angry, drink, get pleased by eating.
I’m close to weeping, ululating!..”
And after resource estimating,
The husband enters terminating
The vengeance time accelerating,
The old ma’am wisdom demonstrating
What haven’s pride she’s demonstrating,
Starts with Onegin recollecting
At the old mill to have a meeting,
They bring her to a public meeting.
God save me at a public meeting
He's leaving the cramped public meeting
Sometimes an unsuspected meeting
And what resulted from the meeting?
Yes, she was puzzled by the meeting,
There, on the first sheet, you are meeting...
Ignore her before fatal meeting.
What happened then upon that meeting
But you, to whom at friendly meeting
Poor girl doesn’t hear the two friends’ greeting;
Though wasn’t prepared to Eugene’s greeting...
Zaretsky after the first greeting
Since, when surfeited with delighting,
It was the tender feels inciting
By vanity, then, hope exciting
She is in panic, close to fainting
- My poor child, are you fainting?
And she is scared and is attempting
Or else, and here without jesting,
A lonely lake, where darks are nesting,
Like drunken wayfarer is nesting,
In sweet oblivion is resting,
Implacable, to love resisting,
To the seductive nets, then, sting
And an old man, who saw him chatting,
Without straining, simply chatting
In front of hostess light talks flitting
Tatiana is unnoticed sitting
Onegin is among them sitting
But finally a deep sigh heaving,
Has hidden entity, when leaving,
But it was late and time for leaving;
The clock is running, time for leaving,
But when he’d reached the one who’s leaving,
With cries flied south. Summer’s leaving.
He was seduced by unchecked craving,
And at same time for all that craving
And for the glory honey craving
“Ah, nanny, nanny, I am grieving,
His heart was close to tear in grieving.
But after Tanya’s note receiving,
That is Onegin’s sacred living.
The Poetry serene and living,
Nor by the art of common living.
To Tanya’s home, where she is living.
This tiresome exhausting driving
The northern wind the clouds driving;
Onegin waits... here’s Lensky driving,
She stops the horse by the reins drawing.
Beating in seizures by the wing,
To Neva’s banks for public viewing!
And, then, present it for reviewing
Not torture show, by death are glowing.
When in the pale sky night stars glowing
My gaze in vain attempts foreknowing.
Grow up, enjoy, boil up and swing,
The round swings they liked to swing,
And dip the jugs, where pipe is playing.
A shepherd’s horn far away playing.
Above a creek was quietly laying
I am afraid that in my praying
It is consumption, people saying.
The invitations, they are saying
The guests in silence wait his saying.
The fields and woods secluded staying,
But on the third day of the staying
Sometimes, he used in bed still staying,
A mincing cat on stove is staying,
In melancholy always staying
In useless boring they are dying.
My heart by shame and fear is dying…
Right here, orthography defying,
They were their feelings signifying...
Romantic roses glorifying
How courteous and gratifying!
Drag after you on chance relying.
I’m fearlessly on it relying…
And pretty sex like fluff is flying.
He slides and falls; the first snow flying
Being forgotten lonely lying.
The one, who’s innocence enjoying,
And I am thankful for enjoying
Your visits really enjoying.
Enough! I am my soul employing
That’s how a hare in field is trying
How nice he was, how hardly trying,
A country maiden I am gazing.
In front of her by glances blazing
His own behavior criticizing
All over. Now we hear a gong,
In dreams immersed, she walked for long.
Had occupied the world for long.
Stays in the stylish cell for long.
I read not much and sleep for long
“Your friend doesn’t visit us for long,
Onegin should not wait for long”.
With other charmed but not for long,
She could not stand and wept for long.
We leave him there. And how for long?
And the black curls to shoulders long.
Is he all right, or something wrong?”
Just the same shepherd sings a song.
Devoting his poetic song
A nightingale starts singing song
Enough, please, sing another song!”
She liked the novels since her young,
Who marvels viewers, mostly young
Where he spent time like ground hog,
At home was sleeping like a log.
To weep, to cry and like a frog
We’ve moored, and should exclaim Hurrah!
Tatiana listened to his preach;
Replaces Breguet watch by stomach;
Just hearing an approaching coach,
Broad-minded, there’s no reproach,
Pomp Moscow shows the same approach.
Despite the common sense approach,
I do not like the Russian speech
And had forgotten the Gods’ speech,
And dare not interrupt his speech.
Is widely used in letters’ speech.
Till now, it’s not the language, which
Loved to hear singing during lunch
He died before the time for lunch,
To organize a friendly lunch,
But since he used at the back porch
He drives to her vitreous porch,
Was by the neighbors bemoaned much,
And Whitsun round dances much,
Is laying pathway on a sleigh.
Will step erecting wide and high.
The fluffy furrows pushing high
Yet, not without heave a sigh
And finally she gave a sigh...
And I (confessing with a sigh)
To show fake sympathy, then, sigh
To overhear the first soul’s sigh,
But should not they just start to laugh
“No, it’s the same. It’s darkened, though.”
This tittle-tattle nonsense, though,
In silence complementing, though
The country is same boredom, though,
Which you will never have enough.
- Here is my elder, Tanya. -“Oh!
I am in love, yes, nanny” - Oh,
Composing intricate blackwash
For those, who are worthless and selfish,
You know, Tatiana found relish
Did not get mad, the life didn’t finish.
And I began to plan and cherish
And both of them were close to perish!
No one requires to relinquish
Collate Onegin with me, gosh,
He passed a doorman in a rush,
And fixed his hair by fingers brush.
On fading brow you see the death,
Like offering prepared for death...
Has turned to the untimely death!
To plan to him untimely death
Shall put on them a wedding wreath...
The virtue gets the triumph wreath.
Is close to lifeless, there’s no wreath;
Not to be lost at a wrong path.
Is not more cared, the former path
The rivals standing on his path,

And how expressively could speak!
His lips compressed, he cannot speak,
Tomorrow morning at daybreak
Is meeting them. They hear a squeak
Under her feet the snow makes squeak.
Reiterate one and same croak,
When your life stream is turning back,
When being poured on pistol’s rack.
Gunpowder leaves a greyish track,
Or manages her way to track,
A fluffy boa on her neck,
She looks at all this fancy chick,
How could he play this spiteful trick
And make the bashful soul so sick!
The high society makes her sick,
She looks so calm, she is not sick!
And speed full tilt to make it quick,
And for the first time clicks a cock.
And Vesper is hailed by a cock.
And pressed his finger to the cock.
She’s leaning against hand by cheek.
And make the friendship sweet and meek.
The tears are streaming, looking meek
He sleeps in peace, he’s always meek.
Like ruddy cherub at Palm week
Rhapsodic manor of the talk,
Reproved for pranks by gentle talk
Is lying by a baby talk.
Of whom a hundred years they talk...
His pistol slowly on the walk
To Summer Garden took for walk.
A dairymaid delivers milk,
N.N. makes pride of all his folk.
I am a figure of high rank.
It happened that instead of ink
Oh, God, save me, what could he think!”
Neither a honey poet’s think,
To be aware of what they think.
He did not move, was mute and pink;
Keeps hope but feels like at a brink;
Fell from a horse, since was dead drunk;
And in the morning read a book;
By reading to him tragic book
Vladimir closes Schiller’s book
A finely molded magic hook
She stops for long and holds her look.
The peasants at the masters look.
Tatiana by a curious look
And doing it with vacant look
At Eugene turned her distant look
And makes a turn at a nice nook.
And solitude of the nice nook,
Have caught his suit flap in the nook.
They ring and pour at the lone nook.
It was, as well, the old lord’s nook.
Let us proceed to a small brook,
Sometimes, a knoll or a small brook
Where flows her native lovely brook,
Side streets extending to the dark,
And nestled at my head in dark?
And thirst for knowledge and for work,
If you need something, please, just ask ...
Holding a sock, a gray Calmyk

Are never ready to conceal
I guessed, perhaps, he’d make a deal.
“Oh, yes, that’s perfect, that’s good deal,
A scandalmonger, that’s the deal...
And having lots of things to deal
And they all stopped attempts to deal
That could not make a better deal.
Have settled an important deal.
I am not good for any deal...
To stay in backwoods looks more real.
And the new sorrow learned for real,
Which touches languid heart for real,
I won’t believe, but is it real,
Nobility and wealth reveal?
(What I for fun used to reveal)
The short comments and marks reveal
The pranks, unfaithfulness reveal...
To cite against looks controversial,
In the high life, how to be formal,
Monsieur l'Abbe was not too formal
Lensky sent challenge to his pal.
Who’ve shot a young and pleasant pal,
And didn't bore him with strict moral,
The future troubles would be fatal.
Another!.. No, it is quite fatal,
The man, whom she adores so fatal,
And you so living and continual
That he is awfully unusual.
For nothing killing time as usual,
Their love, or grief, or other feel.
Onegin’s mind and his feel.
Who are you, maybe, guardian angel,
Yes, it will play! It was the colonel,
The idle talks, clamor and quarrel!
Clothed by the storms with waves I’ll quarrel,
Thirst for the blood and are in quarrel?
He could be funny, cheer by quarrel,
I say without lyric tinsel...
The volume three by Marmontel.
What they were used to call cartel,
Has killed his fellow at a duel,
In mystic gondola we’ll travel.
It is enough with him to travel
Who to the country likes to travel,
Or where you used to shine and revel.
At liberty I’ll play and revel,
In old traditions routine novel
Two days he found it quite novel...
And sanctify by tender novel.
I built the plot of my new novel
Your honor for me is a bail,
(It was a valuable bail!)
Believe me (conscience is my bail)
Like does a convict in a jail.
The marriage for us will make jail.
But maybe’s delayed by the mail. -
Of dad and uncle, old and frail,
He weaves a bast shoe; sick and frail,
Though could not catch it in detail,
And then report you in detail,
Like Roman hero did unveil
The stalls and armchairs are in boil,
Sprouts out in a sunlight boil.
But stir up rage and make it boil.
Thus, grain in spring when falls on soil,
(Forerunner of the morning toil)
Perfectly durable and tranquil,
The world will stay in pleasant tranquil,
Calls to the tree of good and evil...
Or cunning tempter sent by devil:
Right at this minute so much evil
We’d better gallop to a ball,
Or is still posing as oddball?
Like Chatsky got from ship to ball.
She has forgotten noisy ball,
This time you shouldn’t neglect the call. -
How many feelings you do call!
Maybe, will stir my reckless call!
For vague and obscure bliss you call
But they, ...for madrigals they call!
Showed pride and drew up best of all.
That is a subject best of all!
How it did thunder in a hall,
He gets into the crowded hall,
Is watching her across the hall.
A whisper spread in the state hall...
The guests proceed to dining-hall.
Both, modern room and ancient hall.
Onegin speeded after all.
A hamlet, grove and after all
He returned back and after all
Threw it away, and after all
He felt the trouble overall,
Khandra affects him overall,
By girlfriends’ oeuvres overall,
When staining albums overall;
The persons, who don’t smile at all;
His pen had grasped nothing at all,
Then, does not notice him at all...
Tatiana doesn’t care, not at all.
And does not see him, not at all!
You are in fever... - “Not at all,
You want say thank you? - Not at all!
The damsels standing at the wall,
And at a see shore on rock wall.
And like a simpleton he fell.
A Heaven’s creature, from the Hell
Forgave him nothing, I can tell...
(And rhymes, so far as I can tell);
He had a talent, I can tell,
About private things to tell
At the old lime trees and a well,
Yes, he had learned the people well,
It happened, he got trapped as well,
When coming home, at home as well
Could speak good French and wrote as well;
A scholar, but a prig, as well,
Semen Petrovich - fool, as well,
The enemies and friends, as well
Affecting Russian names, as well
To ombre, Boston, whist, as well,
Though didn’t perceive his talents well,
In native language could not well.
He danced Mazurka very well
His albums’ sheets were very well
At dawn, a shepherd at the hill
Under the lee of a small hill,
It’s fearful! To avoid the thrill
Present to you (that makes me thrill)
In high society’s fatal thrill.
Repentance brings his soul to thrill,
Appeared to me and brought to thrill,
The clever mind and soul’s thrill,
Your lovely gaze impelled my thrill,
This girl, who didn’t stir any thrill,
And thinks that he is beloved still,
But I in love was dumb and still.
Have dropped the eyes, the foes stand still.
The olden sorrow stirs me still.
Don’t let the poet’s soul to still,
Alas, again, and all stays still. -
I cannot catch it well, but still
Caught fame and glory by God’s will.
Controlled by Providence’s will;
To stay for long he did not will,
An independent lively will,
But after falling gravely ill
She saw a mansion from a knoll,
Even a nonsense, which is droll,
A neighbor belfry’s early toll
Could respond keenly or look dull,
Streams in the glasses clinking cool.
Of a smart man could make a fool
He played with me the card game Fool.”
Bribe taker, glutton and fair fool.
A cue is resting on a pool,
A lash for riding on a stool
Here, at the window on this stool,
In front of the affected girl
An album of exalted girl
With an obedient doll the girl
And bidding farewell to the girl
The features of a tender girl?
A curtain rustles in a whirl.
The lightness of the passions whirl?
No, never ever passions’ whirl
And people will be for that thankful.
Which made excited and were fearful,
Inspiring words so nice and blissful
Ideal, folkish, sometimes blissful,
Semi-amusing, semi-wistful,
And he believed, there is a soul,
To show to you my naked soul?
By her good looks and kind soul.
May be because her simple soul
With dreams of my reflective soul.
By noble impulses of soul
And tender dreams in flaming soul.
To whom you wrote with burning soul?
You really rouse in Russian soul!
And he sometimes disturbed her soul?
No doubt, it disturbed her soul,
The dim emotions stirred her soul.
She can’t learn an escape for soul.
My shame, whenever my poor soul
A drop of pity in your soul,
An uhlan captured Olga’s soul.
Just Olga occupied his soul,
No, nothing could awake his soul,
When reading passions of his soul
His fame by meanness of his soul,
Were deeply harassing his soul.
Who loved the youth by all his soul,
Will not at all disturb my soul,
Was so much rankling in my soul!
An epigram stirs in my soul,

I can lend money to you, ma’am”.
A creek is silvered by a beam,
Here was metropolis’s cream,
And my Onegin in a dream
Is she that girl ... or it’s a dream?
What’s going on? Is it a dream!
For long … No, that was not a dream!
Suffused with consecrated dream
Like in a bad and obscure dream
It languished her like troubling dream;
You’re followed by an unreal dream
His lonely soul immersed in dream
The impulses of virgin dream
And all around was in dream,
And burning solitary dream
With ice not bonded gray-haired stream.
Into a sweet and sinless stream.
Full of live verity by stream.
It runs and bubbles making steam.
Clears out through a morning steam.
Bows, misses' kisses, shuffling, jam,
The sprinkling bubbles and the foam
But gushing out hissing foam
The kids’ and nurses’ cries and cram.
By bold and biting epigram;
That scoffed at sisters’ monogram,
They send Onegin to hakeem,
The thoughts and ease in high esteem.
And charming ease in high esteem.
Those, who get overall esteem,
His sound talk of this of them.
I do remind you of them!
In general despised all them,
Olga’s admirer came to them,
Where nothing can disturb or hit them;
Next week you should go visit them. -
What can I tell about them...
Use to declaim his solemn poem
The morning lily blossom’s stem,
Did strike a bullet in the aim.
Alone, not decorated, dim.
They stay in front in calm and dim
Or with the years would just get dim.
When dusting post-chaise speeded him,
Nor sigh or glance could now excite him,
And something stirred inside of him,
Dared polish nails in front of him,
Princess that sits in front of him,
The elegies gush out of him
And she agrees to dance with him.
And even keep in touch with him.
And this prescribes the spa to him.
And bedroom shoes, and serves to him.
Onegin follows after him;
And she pronounced... that is him!
My lips did whisper: it is him!
Tatiana casts a glance at him...
A regiment of lenders brought him
A common fate could await him,
Got really mad, when pompous Grim
And fascinates by bliss and calm.
Of wise and reasonable calm,
In wilderness, in charming calm,
For country’s fascinating calm,
In the high life’s stir and in calm
Produces languishing and boredom?
To O... Excuse, to this, to whom...
On Saturday. My dear and mom
You drink desire’s magic venom,
I’m loving you to edge of doom;
The burning torch, two hearts and bloom,
The mouths chew, and in the room
They sit in front like bride and groom,
He’s always with her. In her room
In the dark shades of leafy room.
How long he’s here and where’s he from,
“Where are the days of my life blossom?
A storm did breathe, the charming blossom
To his hereditary farm,
Of lyre’s creative tongue and charm.
Recites poor madrigal, shows charm,
Suspecting in it a great harm
The sunrise stretches crimson arm
And squeezes gently Olga’s arm.
The willful passions in a swarm.
Will understand the Russian term,
And is khandra in Russian term),
Is vulgar (Can’t find other term...
There are two men in uniform...
It does attract by pleasant form
I shall depict in passion’s storm,
Though, I am far from criticism.)
Drowned us in fade romanticism
(And we call this romanticism?
And always hopeless egoism.
Like drunken Delvig in delirium.
And by the view of dad and mum
Doesn’t know what is deceit and can
Through magic crystal it to scan.
He gets as soon as only can.
In front of them I feel so mean,
Has interfered; and he is mean,
What does the kinfolk in fact mean.
To whirl with her at guests began,
Zaretsky, sometimes hooligan,
Where author knows the nature more than
The gambling gangsters ataman,
Will pet the laurels of old man!
Will occupy me being old man.
And a suspicious old man,
And call the boisterous old man
An evil fellow or good man?
As real sage and noble man,
Here was an angry gentleman,
We shall decoy a young man
(A pleasure for effete young man),
And thoughts and feelings of young man,
Thus, after farewell to the woman
The less you show your love to woman,
And I should add an honest man...
Ivan Petrovich - greedy man,
And bolder than a healthy man
But now a kind easy man,
Onegin raised his hand with moan,
Did you emit a doleful moan
The parquet uttered loud groan,
And run to unrestricted span.
My future novel’s obscure span,
She walked and walked, all of a sudden
Misfortune came all of a sudden.
Disturbed the calm all of a sudden.
The quarrel flares, all of a sudden
He’d really got all of a sudden
She looks aware. A simple maiden,
Spread by the river uncared garden.
She looks at the deserted garden
And they went home circling the garden;
He gave her lesson in the garden,
When I’d got rid of public burden
Not as a bigot, but be keen
Just viewing those produces spleen.
The still bare forests start to green
With soul like born in Gottingen,
Onegin comes to Olga, then
Opinion of a husband, then,
To tell few words to you and then
Disliked these awfully, and then
“If you are in a shortage, then,
Paterfamilias (single), then,
To duel barrier bring them, then,
And with cherries pelt him, then,
The hostess asked a question, then...
Two Petriadas, grammar, then
Why is Tatiana guiltier then?
The sick man writes a letter, then,
And to provoke derisions then!
Thus, not one pencil he had broken
To all these Circes and spoiled men,
And all of them are far from freemen.
The epicurean-sage men,
(To please the women and the men
E sempre bene, gentlemen.
Like at a picture standing men,
Exchanged the bows with sitting men,
Could cause to quarrel the young men,
But there, where stormy Melpomen
A thirst for ruling over omen...
Cannot avoid despise to men,
Thus, he’d left books like did with women,
A song of Volga’s fishermen.
To tell the truth, I hate Hymen,
Though, also different could happen,
Or marked by Baratynsky’s pen,
I know, that tender Parny’s pen
The sun was shining not so often,
We, sometimes, would prefer to listen
With a note by the poet written.
Here was Prolasov, who had gotten
Since she is trustful and from Heaven
And, maybe, sometimes willed by heaven,
Then please do know, I swear by Heaven,
She did not move a muscle, even
The mollycoddled fingers even
By good intention being driven,
And whom this time he’ll try to feign?
How to hold over like a reign
Like winter cold and sovereign,
Who at the Neva’s banks does reign.
Was criticizing mill design.
She wants to know what does it sign,
Your eyes will radiate disdain,
That’s it! I’m scared to read again…
Was dressed, undressed and dressed again?
Gets up in p.m., and again
You’ll never have a chance again;
And she is sitting... She again!
And never will be back again?
Then, they began to talk again
Would make them bosom friends again!
And counts hours again.
To dream of seeing you again,
I’ll show Onegin now again.
Now taciturn, then, gay again,
Success is not her major gain,
He would be glad to cast off chain,
To write the letters and complain,
But love yourself and don’t complain,
Chateaubriand used to explain.
I planned like Alban to explain
By my sad mystery explain.
Ah, maybe then her love and pain
How can you with your heart and brain
Neither by wittiness of brain,
Incomprehensible for brain;
All of them in the dreamer’s brain
The admiration sense by brain,
Because his features pleased my brain...
Poetic dreams will leave my brain,
But now not that disturbs my brain.
From all these things you should refrain.
Begins to drip refreshing rain),
The rings appear by magic train;
The Christen world will then obtain
He didn’t forget and did retain.
I know that you till now retain
Making a lively cheering fountain
The inns for people entertain.
How the virgins entertain.
Or it is fruitless and in vain
And finally to live in vain
Tried to chase shade of love in vain.
To suffer thirst of love in vain,
Oh, my dear friends, is all in vain?
However hard he tries, in vain.
Tried to read Schiller, yet, in vain,
Though he considered it in vain
The so called friends! And not in vain
Don’t spend your energy in vain,
And like Onegin left world’s vain,
The rights, when sudden storms begin.
“Well, shall we start?” - applied Onegin.
But he was wrong... that time Onegin
Eugene Onegin
She dropped ... “He’s here, Onegin!
Tatiana’s letter to Onegin
Like Childe Harold looks Onegin,
“It cannot be, - reflects Onegin, -
That’s what exactly thought Onegin.
And who is he? Is it Onegin?
He was not dumb, that’s why Onegin,
Alas, no doubt, my Onegin
Chadaev’s copy, my Onegin,
We wonder what she’s looking in.
Frenchman Gilliotte is coming in,
To scare by recklessness a virgin,
Clarissa, Julia, Dauphin,
In winter, when the days are thin,
And then presents his friend and kin.
Is safer than of friends and kin...
By A.S. Pushkin
The only heir of all his kin.
She named Praskov’ya Paulin,
Like herald blows - the day comes in.
The freedom’s potentate Fonvisin
Can catch her fancy and then ruin
Oh, how could I forget, Goddamn!
Appears in front. It looks so solemn.
The sky was breathing by the autumn
A fancy sayings’ lexicon,
And by the way, two words in an add-on...
Then, Lensky comes; the light flashed on;
His uncle wants to say last pardon,
In vain some time ago Napoleon
“He dwells not far, at Simeon;
And gives an answer... Agafon.
What is your name? He’s looking on
It is what she is looking on.
My thirtieth birthday coming on!
She glanced at him. “What’s going on?”
“Left? Where is it? What’s going on?”
Where foster child of the fashion
Cannot change that despite of fashion,
That’s true, of course. But whirl of fashion,
Invents for fun according fashion,
And planned to show the modern fashion
His hair was cut in modern fashion,
Which among men of upright fashion
Farewell to you, my odd companion,
Her darling frisky young companion,
Deceases suddenly, the minion
Here is this scandalmongers’ minion...
The one with whom would make a union,
I’d formed with tender Muse a union
When I forsook their young communion
Which’s of a similar communion,
And in a sulk made a decision
And what a vicious derision,
Appeared like light majestic vision,
Does not produce attractive vision
And now rejoicing in his vision
Princess is single in the mansion.
There is a place nearby to mansion,
“Can you show me the landlord’s mansion?” -
To supersede by will and passion
Maybe, the ancient flame of passion
I ever wished it with such passion
In the old days you showed compassion,
Which kills the old with no compassion.
I’ll recall speech of tender passion,
A heart that beats in tender passion?
Who prompted her this tender passion
No one restrained Onegin’s passion,
To intercept a lady’s passion,
Being inflamed by purest passion.
He started reading in succession
To pray and call for a confession,
The naive souls’ sincere confession.
Sincere cordial confession,
And did not bring to him confession.
Then, they require her confession
The trustful naive girl’s confession,
For the perfidious aggression.
By jealous anguish and depression.
Promoting splendid life impression
Can I depict my true impression,
Had left a serious impression
He always leaves the best impression,
It looks like someone’s hand compression
And words amicable expression?
Or breast stirred up by love expression.
Besides, the nature’s self-expression,
The ardent poet’s self-expression;
But what a boredom is the session...
What trifle brought you to this session!
Meanwhile, Onegin’s evening mission
My fruits of reveries effusion
I read to nanny in seclusion,
And all of them made a conclusion
Saw poor Tatiana’s perturbation,
(Despite well-reasoned deprecation)
When the good willing education
He comes inside with trepidation;
Tatiana is in trepidation,
And this invaluable creation
Onegin hated litigation
These talks with sighs of consolation.
Provoked the tears, brought consolation...
With lapse of time (and calculation
I offer my congratulation
He’s killed! This dreadful exclamation
Or with the nature animation
I love this youthful animation,
Devoid of any animation,
Alone, immersed in estimation,
He cannot find explanation...
His soul is full of indignation!
Regret, deep sorrow, indignation
He’s jealous, flushed by indignation,
And the inflamed imagination,
For long her flamed imagination
To entertain imagination
Remain and stir imagination,
Till now disturbs imagination.
My pen has no more inclination
He didn’t have any inclination
The Moon - night sky illumination,
The signs and marks cause rumination...
Yes, they are close to destination,
By high society’s dissipation,
That should repay their declaration
How often in sad separation,
The mother suffered separation
Neither long years of separation,
Perceiving it as separation;
Produced in Eugene bad vibration.
The beauties’ novel generation
And launch the rhymes to operation.
Romantic noble aspiration,
Where dwelled the kid of inspiration...
Whose gaze, exiting inspiration,
But you, the youthful inspiration,
Nor learning fruits, nor inspiration
And what a lively inspiration
Of all his feels and adoration -
You learn the pangs of adoration,
The charming dreams of adoration,
Of friends and maidens’ adoration.
And being close to hard frustration
We do associate frustration
Or just the virgin soul’s frustration!
And their seductive figuration
They animated conversation
The poet’s flaming conversation,
And dazzled by an expectation
For long a secret expectation
By former simple habitation,
He’s faded! Where’s his excitation,
For your poetic meditation?
Alike stirred his blood agitation,
And Tanya hiding agitation,
And stirred the common agitation.
She felt unreasoned hesitation,
And did it with no hesitation,
That can resolve her hesitation.
Please, settle my heart hesitation.
But before gets an invitation
Blessed is who witted exaltation,
And cram, and shine and exaltation,
The heart is stirred in exaltation,
Vladimir, when in exaltation,
He has brought her to exaltation,
Tatiana heard with some vexation
And can remain in sad distraction,
The other drove her off distraction,
But this so serious distraction
Today, Lovelace has lost attraction,
At beauty’s legs in the affection
You wouldn’t deny, shy girl’s affection
And shows his real soul’s affection.
Effusion of your soul’s affection;
The other gained her heart’s affection,
Oh, Moscow, what a great affection
To pale and still in great affection!
Though ill-willed people's imperfection
By loving soul all your perfection,
Me by his noble soul’s perfection,
I can’t foresee any objection,
You cannot claim any rejection;
Did not display the moon reflection,
What was response? The stern reflection.
It was unusual strange collection.
In former passions recollection,
It’s time to change my tale direction
Keep your lorgnette at right direction,
Am I not glad to resurrection
For landlords’ property protection!)
And what is he? Is he just fiction,
A foreign oddity affliction,
With Lensky unexpected friction,
Onegin’s sudden apparition,
Ran to Anisiya with intention
Without malice or intention;
Then, to the books she paid attention,
The beauties drew no more attention
In epicenter of attention
And she examines with attention
They sing, but just with no attention
I have attracted your attention
And what a serious attention
And to your daughters pay attention,
(That was the locals’ smart invention
It is a countrymen’s convention...
To catch a minute of emotion,
To dreams spontaneous devotion,
Onegin had more just perception;
But (are there rules with no exception?)
But still retains the sense and gumption.
Three years she’s suffering consumption,
Decided to accept this option
Extended to her; she with caution
Or being sank into oblivion
Thus, people sink into oblivion
But just he fell into oblivion
He recites them in sweet oblivion,
He looks at her in sweet oblivion
I’ll be engaged by other demon,
Is this delight to me uncommon,
An ardent spirit (quite uncommon),
For tender verses it’s uncommon,
A heavy gossip, old buffoon,
The night falls down, and the moon
At obscure novel and so on.
The troubles, boredom and so on.
The tears, the verses and so on?
The future triumph coming soon
The neighbor, and please do it soon.
The clever husband very soon
Inwardly drew the guests cartoon.
What do I want? What is the reason
Flashed on and off, though despite reason
He, who did live and used to reason,
How often in a summer season,
But in my north, the summer season
Where you spent time in winter season,
In backwoods, what to do this season?
In fireplace the flame was on,
It grabs her quickly and speeds on;
Yes, she was fond of Richardson
And, thus, preferring Grandison
Do you remember Grandison?”
And super peerless Grandison,
You can be a pragmatic person,
Is he just odd and harmful person,
He wasn’t at all a lofty person
It is for others a good lesson,
I used to spend my last one lepton
You gave a lesson, I did learn.
That’s what I love to see and learn.
That she, how we from London learn,
Will native grammar start to learn,
How skillful was he to look modern,
And all the way was mute and stern.
Poisoned by jealousy and stern!
I shall rehearse you being stern
She is approaching looking stern
Swung a strange wreath above the urn;
She escapes to the park to mourn,
To dissipate his spouse’s mourn
Is always frowning, taciturn,
And in his study’s taciturn
Her heart has sunk, she’s scared to turn.
I think today it is my turn.
To follow you at every turn.
And whisper visiting my urn...
Besides, it starts the joy and fun -
Intend to play or to make fun,
How at the balls the nobles fun.
Could hold his tongue or make it fun,
Will die, and we shall see just fun
That looks like fence while speedy run.
Has faded at the early dawn,
He’d perished at the early dawn,
In the dead silence being drawn.
The cot in mystery is drawn.
Like in a doleful shadow drawn;
Morality inspires a yawn,
Who causes nothing but a yawn, -
Then took a pen and stifling yawn
Sprout out, mature and fade down
And what? Don’t worry. I calm down
To seclude corner and puts down
Isn’t he from backwoods so well known?
By caring hands of an unknown.
She shyly stands under a crown,
Vladimir answered with a frown
Looked like not being of their own.
You are familiar, my own.
I call to you, please come and do,
But let it be, what can I do,
A friend or enemy, I do
By a home circle like all do,
The sacred monogram E. O.
Which should be cleared long time ago
The country woke up long ago,
He looks and sees, that long ago
Imprison me. Not long ago
To what had happened far ago.
And just an instant far ago
I happened meet you years ago,
Where in the evening he will go.
And with the wife he had to go.
“It’s over six and time to go,
The night is falling, time to go,
She was my neighbor”. - Then, let’s go. -
He should leave home and now must go.
A dreadful signet of inferno...
But always simply yes or no”.
Yet, Moscow said to him just “No!”,
Can she be here? Oh, yes ... But, no...
Here is my novel in verse hero,
In a nice nook, where my tale’s hero,
We’ll say good bye to my tale’s hero,
The friends as just an added zero,
Hymned in the verses by Naso,
Arose in him aversion, so
The books by Gibbon and Russo,
Of Richardson and J. Russo.
Though, did not know, why is it so)
You shouldn’t come to listen to
Romantic eloquent madcap.
Do not let travelers to nap;
Twice yearly fast they used to keep,
Where is Onegin? Half asleep,
Then, all this bliss made him asleep,
But Tanya feels like in a sleep.
St. Petersburg does never sleep,
And nothing can affect his sleep,
Tatiana in the dark doesn’t sleep,
Began to cough and then to weep.
But hears behind the bear’s step!
He draw the friends to the last step
On vernal flowers they step?
With droopy head sits at the lamp;
She dare not seal it with carved stamp.
A bottle made a loud pop,
Three tears by each they used to drop,
At poetasters yells... “do stop
That it is not too smart to stop
Is making hiss; Trike can’t stop
Bitterly cried and could not stop.
But he is stubborn, does not stop
The sense of epigraphs could grasp.
The Russian rhymes began to grasp.
The Being revel and full cup
And wine like comet jets to cup,
In limpid darkness you flicked up,
The cups on saucers just picked up,
Of wine has not yet bottomed up,
And asks the servant to catch up,
And where my heart I’ve given up.
In rush Onegin dresses up
Gets in, - a cork with pop springs up,
A bear, a big disheveled bear;
Witch, hedgehog, snowdrift, cot, fir, bear.
Oh, what an early bird, my dear!
Invisible, you were my dear,
They place them opposite my dear,
It disturbs stomach. Oh, my dear...
The mistress shouts... “Oh, my dear!”
You’re growing pale again, my dear!”
Not only sadness... yes, my dear,
And nowadays from you, my dear,
Feels quite a reasonable fear...
The bear behind, she’s in fear;
Speeds at full tilt in a great fear;
Besides, perhaps, of secret fear.
Last evening you awoke my fear!
The one, which even kids did hear...
But clinking of the spurs we hear,
A frequent question I do hear...
The shining sky is blue and clear,
You, who are flaming, smart and clear,
Mincing, provincial, unclear,
He is a master, it is clear,
The night is frosty, sky is clear,
There golden earring drops from ear.
By divine train in calm appear.
When cheeks aglow will disappear.
Why did Vladimir disappear?
As a princess I now appear,
Did not compress her lips, I swear!
Then nobody, but you, I swear,
Then, all the rest time of the year
And to Tatiana every year
It’s time to finish it, so far!
When was deceived - take rest so far.
Or so mysterious Sbogar.
Born at a garret by a liar
She’s peeping through the door ajar...
A beau of Julia Volmar,
Malek-Adel and de Linar,
The music tiers to make roar,
Avoided public life’s uproar,
And was annoyed with high life’s roar;
And after bring her a guitar...
In a wide hat la Bolivar
They call him to a samovar,
At lies of magazines, at war,
He’d settled in the mansion’s chamber,
Mazurka started. I remember,
The blood runs cold, when I remember
The latter is the same club’s member,
And you, my favorable reader,
Well, well! My kind noble reader,
Whoever are you, my verse reader,
I do not want a mocking reader
Yes, take it please, my eager reader!)
No matter what could be, my reader,
You should agree with me, my reader,
But what is friendship? We consider
Her head has bent to naked shoulder,
To smash a vessel of a slander;
Who does not sow a bitter slander,
He, who was order’s foe and squander,
The liberty and rights defender
This time was wrong that way to render.
Persuade, dissuade, and then surrender
It was so noble to surrender...
Who’s with you always nice and tender?
Amazes Tania like a wonder,
And what did me at all that wonder?
Like being stricken by a thunder.
When shall I leave this boring order?
The uhlan got an urgent order
Who gave the necessary order!
And feared like a chased fallow deer;
Zaretsky, rural engineer,
To be more modest I prefer
And what so far he will prefer?
With no astonishment or anger...
And dashing song of remote singer...
The killer of the youthful singer?”
Her summer walks are getting longer.
It seems to me, when being younger,
I won’t let terrible debaucher
And their selection puzzled her,
By amour flatter conquered her;
There’s unknown yard in front of her,
Their gazes are just burning her.
A general, who came with her,
All these are pointed to her,
Who prompted touching voice to her,
Onegin, then, came close to her
Prince brings Onegin close to her,
They opened universe to her,
And he directs lorgnette to her.
And would not you forgive to her
An elegy prepares to her.
He stood up, gave a bow to her
She’s running, but it chases her,
It was a year, when autumn weather
Neither to mother, nor to father,
And when the nanny used to gather
The country’s morals become rather
Both bored when gathering together,
Who won’t annoy, like does the other?
Talk over her between each other
Preparing perish to each other.
With groan said the senile mother. -
“The dreams and years have passed, another
She turns one page after another,
- Please, pour me half a glass more, brother...
I love you by a love of brother
I loved you not by love to brother,
He should disarm the younger brother,
Ruffianoff, who’s my ardent brother,
I write to you, - what can be further?
And blessed me stepping to the bier.
Promised far trip and cavalier.
The stage’s vicious fashion maker,
The charming actresses’ caretaker,
How young was he to be dissembler,
And a young lady - city dweller,
Tatiana lived - a naive dreamer.
Romantic pal and pensive dreamer
That is, by what divine Homer
When we shall resort at a banner
- I hate your high society’s manner
Where will proceed my naughty partner?
Eugene is now the only owner
Bark, laughter, singing, whistle, scamper,
Please listen to me with no temper...
The guests start moving to sit denser;
To order Olga tea, and later
“And also, yes, ... but let’s talk later.
No answer, yet. Just some days later
Watches the wax sunk in the water.
When being told at night in winter.
I’m not an evil virgins tempter,
If you could know, what a disaster
Someone, who looks like wistful jester,
Makes me annoyed, and not to pester
I’m switching to the elder sister.
To burn, then, terminate to foster
And people’s talk, and horses’ clatter!
My God, please save us from the latter,
And I believe (myself I flatter!)
But heart ache is an acid matter,
Onegin didn’t postpone the matter
From prince NN. What is the matter?
She’s pale and worries, what’s the matter,
I gave my word. But what’s the matter,
(And these are probably same matter)
How can I settle this tough matter?
When waking up, he gets a letter
A passionate and reckless letter.
Had read this sad and grievous letter
To represent my beauty’s letter.
There’s no reply. He writes next letter,
A day flew by - no reply letter,
The issue will retain my letter,
The lamps are lighting by a glitter.
And none of them would ever waver
The heart beats faster in a fever
“Who now arouses your lyre’s fever?
When passions and excitement fever
She did not show just any fever,
I should be wise, I should be clever,
I am so old and no more clever.
She must detest him being clever
To frighten men for them is clever.
With handsome face and who is clever,
He should not say a word, oh, never!
Forgetting shame claim it wherever
And am not able, never ever,
And will gain nothing, never ever;
She will not see him never-ever,
The youthful bliss has passed forever
And think that life is light forever.
Stroke up close friendship just forever.
For long, and probably for ever.
For winter nature craved, however,
But Terpsichore’s cute leg, however,
In the estate above a river,
A boat was gliding dozing river
And captives of the Salgir river...
The spacious fields are shining silver...
And Christmas eve’s majestic cover.
He should nobility uncover
But maybe you can still discover
Shouldn’t they try peace way to discover?
Walks by a clearing’s snowy cover
Still thinks of him. The page’s turned over,
You may disdain me and moreover
The theatre tiers glancing over
And now a page you’re turning over,
Tatiana’s letter I look over,
Ai is similar to lover -
And when the childhood was over,
And anyhow the day is over,
She’d learned a hold to get it over
The gentlemen bowed a bit lower
But cannot get a clear answer,
And yawning listened to a prayer;
And proud coldness in the air,
In front of Olga, nice and fair,
You were correct with me and fair
Her look is always calm and fair,
A baker - German, clean and fair,
To reward you more just and fair
A duel must by just and fair,
We must respect them and be fair,
Your perfect features and are fair.
Among the people who are fair,
Though, still attractive and quite fair.
You’ve paid for recklessness quite fair.
The inconspicuous charming fair,
High, lofty, tender, daring, fair?
And husbands’ friendship so unfair!
To the old aunt, who’s sick, but fair.
I’d love to be my lady fair.
Her falling down flowing hair,
In glasses and fake reddish hair.
Steel files for nails and combs for hair,
A fragrant old man with gray hair,
To the babushka in despair.
The days ran fast; the winter air
The morning noise refreshes air.
Eternal Jew or brave Corsair
The flocking herds and country air;
Dose not say yes, ma’am, or no, sir,
But in her breast she feels same stir,
He wished to write, but patient labor
A neighbor sniffs in front a neighbor,
And also sometimes gnaw a neighbor,
Cowberry water for the neighbor,
And did it to the health of neighbor.
Could not eclipse her modest neighbor.
And to the same conformist neighbor
Despite of all her marble splendor
It's cram, excitement and ardor,
I’ve read what you have pleaded for...
The art the poet suffered for,
The reckless heart inspired for
It’s not the thing I’m searching for,
And languishing it’s searching for
Each morning I am waking for
Am I the one you did search for,
I write these lines one reason for,
He gives a sign - gets what asks for,
Is vague and obscure; where, what for
And tried to read them, but what for?
I love you, but what is it for?
An ardent thrilling novel author
- Believe me... truly... my behavior...
A cloud of a deadly pallor
When snow is painted in pink color,
She looks around, in a parlor
And people hustled in the parlor.
Damask wallpaper in the parlor,
Since early morning Larin’s manor
The elder does not see the minor
But he, at that, prefers the minor,
As did the pretty charming minor,
And standing leaning on a door
Where at the courtyard’s entrance door
It opens squeaky entrance door
The nanny opens bedroom door
Tatiana looks at outdoor
The dancing couples flood the floor.
And puts Tatiana on the floor.
Trike is lying on the floor
One of her feet touches the floor,
Steps on the stage, on parquet floor,
And warely steps on squeaky floor;
That make me feeling sick and poor.
Till now, my God, I feel so poor,
“But all in elegy is poor,
There is a fortune telling mirror.
Please, follow me, give me a favor,
Let’s do it, please, give me a favor.
- Ah, nanny, can you give a favor. -
Alas, but the young paramour,
His crackling language's was ist das.
All these adornments Olga has.
Which never had and never has
Cannot deny it... yes, it has.
Life-giving voice has died, alas;
The wreath of youth has drooped, alas?
I value hours, - alas,
Ruffianov wooed - reject, alas.
She bemoaned over you, alas!
And he recalled sweetheart Tatiana’s
And say politely “Bye, grandpas!”
At first, Onegin’s language was
How awfully caustic he was!
But my poor Lensky... yes, he was
- What, Grandison? How great he was!
Her future spouse at that time was
But fatty pasty that time was
Have come by carriages, by cabs,
Both, very true and purely fibs,
When at that time headache disturbs;
The elevated Muses’ lyrics
For neighbors, friends and both their dads
The neighbors shaking pompous heads
Attracts a novel, which she reads,
Extended far away its spreads -
A pensive shelter for Dryads.
He is just happy, no more odds...
Enough, my friend, enough, no odds!
Du comme il faut... (Shishkov, no odds,
That all the best expected deeds
We’re glad to take as real deeds,
To him on tiptoe Tanya speeds;
The brushes more than thirty breeds
By hooded carts, by open sleds.
These eves at home and all the maids
Would die in peace among his kids,
By wavy carpets covered fields.
She streams back home to woods and fields,
And hurries to the groves and fields,
To watch remoteness of the fields,
Just here (when on the shoots of fields
She slowly rides by open fields.
And roams alone in woods in fields. -
Which was not touched in grass’s wilds
The same through glasses do the olds,
Like was established by the olds...”
As was established by the olds.
An idol with the clinched crossed hands
They throw the cloaks to free the hands,
Stroll every morning holding hands.
I’m feeling female’s leg in hands!
Tatiana didn’t take dolls on hands
With “Russian Journal” in their hands!
Has run onto the drowned flood lands
The snow has left the local highlands
The fog laid on the bottom lands,
Since scarcely in the Russian lands
Of many peasants, forests, lands,
Someday they’ll get the magic brands
And in my garden now she stands,
With covered by hat dull brow stands.
And finally, when music ends,
These were the mysteries and legends
Tatiana trusted in the legends
Like with her best and beloved friends
The sweet discussions with the friends.
With my Onegin to make friends.
And in the garden like close friends
The people’s sacramental friends,
Forgot the city and his friends,
It is an album, where, my friends,
To read in Russian. Ah, my friends!
To get it. I retain, my friends,
The autumn storm destroys and rends,
Or tell the news or fashion trends.
It’s where my cherished dream extends...
Tatiana reads the books and finds
And leaves the bed, raises the blinds.
Pour out light and cheer the minds,
But Breguet watch’s bell reminds...
(It somehow English spleen reminds
She broke the obscured mind’s bonds.
Is flying to the blooming grounds.
In other words, twenty four rounds,
And curses all that her surrounds,
They argue, laugh, make funny sounds.
Remind me the vernal floods...
We like the ladies glide the boards.
The table, sofa, two cupboards,
Then, he sees slanderers, mean cowards,
And remained sitting afterwards.
Like being busy afterwards.
Her mourn. She started to keep records,
He didn’t like visit local landlords,
To say good by to their landlords.
Am I correct, my dear milords?
He trembles, cannot find words,
Through set teeth just a couple words,
I can’t select the Russian words).
And after left with solemn words,
And pour the spicy bitter words,
Since does not hear the fans’ applauds,
In drawing room the people crowds,
The anthem of the future tribes
On the dull stage the well-known faces,
On the dull stage the well-known faces,
Thus, aunty Helen’s hat with laces
The innocence of rural places,
Let me glance back. Farewell to places,
Then on a padded chair her places
And to the front till now it places
Oh, Brenta, Adriatic spaces,
The country, flowers, field spaces,
The world and reveal real graces.
Moustaches, hills and special graces.
You dedicated your lyre’s graces?
Indifferent to the new graces,
Indifferent to the new graces,
For past naive Tatiana’s traces,
Are so deceptive... like feet’s traces!
To leave this world without traces.
The end of waltz with her he dances.
These enchantresses’ words and glances
How fast and tender were his glances!
Some poetaster from armed forces
With all these tiresome resources,
The memoirs, recollection sources,
And covered by acacia shades,
In leafy forest’s saving shades
I spent in idleness in shades.
He fell in love with forests’ shades,
A fan of peaceful Aonides,
A circle of the future brides -
To Moscow, to the fair of brides!
Where do you think my hero rides?
The secret winter troika’s rides;
And like a flying arrow rides.
To bring the barrels and besides,
With Olga strange behave, besides,
She does not raise him up, besides,
What can I tell to you besides?
“Not, yet! Please, do compose the odes,
Vladimir would love to write odes,
Like from a hive a swarm of bees
To wish to nestle at your knees
By silver were embellished trees,
The awful bear groans, falls the trees,
Has decorated knots of trees,
She’s come to senses, looks and sees...
She peeps through chink, and what she sees?
But pitiful is who foresees,
Yes, Tanya my tale’s hero sees,
The feather beds, cocks in the cages,
To be extracted from the ages.
And glory him in future ages;
On many read by Tanya pages
When doing that, two or three pages,
By billet-doux on seven pages,
On almanac’s by time worn pages
And, maybe, on the public stages
The love can conquer any ages,
And finally they've packed the sledges
Above the waters iron bridges
The river beds and high top ridges.
But you don’t see in them the changes,
How unexpected were these changes!
But when the turn Onegin reaches,
And very often idle speeches
(I love the friendly idle speeches
They are not worthy of these speeches,
I shall retell the casual speeches
With no concern she hears their speeches,
To see you and to hear your speeches,
Regards, congratulations, speeches,
Are beaming brightly through the branches
Has hanged on naked bushes’ branches,
It’s come and scattered, with white bunches
Here a long bough her collar catches,
Where heeding my sonorous strophes
Tatiana to the forest dashes;
The flame is dying, by the ashes
And hearing your majestic splashes
And by the slightly noticed splashes
Of people’s tears and clapping splashes
The circle top with clapping splashes,
When hearing how a forest breathes?
With enmity the poet seethes
Where after changing of the clothes
Just getting rid of swaddling clothes.
I know, they try to force the ladies
And you, young pretties (not the ladies),
It happens, though, some noble ladies
And all these fancy looking ladies.
I saw the other whimsy ladies,
Aristocrats and army dandies
His everyday routine and studies
The smoke from pipes in chimney dies,
Chaldean sage, who clarifies
All that his image purifies
The pines are rising to the skies,
Who wouldn’t be worn by threats and lies,
Today a simple gravestone lies.
Sat at a window and crushed flies.
Neither by bees nor butterflies.
Gets inside like a swallow flies.
How smart I was when telling lies.
By the light jest or other lies.
Looks like offense, or fun, or lies,
And Strasburg pie so neatly lies
Dies in the violins’ roars and cries.
On inflamed tongue pink sticker dries,
The freedom-loving reveries,
The vice is welcomed, in the stories
With cherries and raspberries
Forgot of all the other worries.
She stops at it and puzzled tries
To overcome the ills and ties).
And loving scope the mind ties,
However, love of tender pretties
He stopped to fall in love with beauties,
When was declined - no painful duties,
I used to feed you with the cakes!
With no grammatical mistakes.
“Farewell to you, the lovely dales
And he perceived the magic tales.
But pleased me by the magic tales,
She wasn’t involved, but loved the tales,
Attention to the young men’s tales
The British Muse’s fairytales
Fears, rumors, lively fairy tales
And with the groves and lovely vales
Who never trusted to odd fables,
(Frivolous blather, idle fables
A set of vulgar folkish fables,
Didn’t keep away from high life’s rabbles,
Leaned on the desk she something scribbles.
She does not notice all his troubles,
The waltz is spinning, by the circles
Where the old timer for great whiles
The old ones could not hold the smiles,
His pen by adoration smiles;
The trendy foe of trendy belles,
The sleigh speeds over the potholes,
Replaced to me the law and rules,
By moving heads of noble dames
The flying feet of dancing dames
Of pretty girls and well known dames.
Neither lorgnettes of jealous dames,
And sentimental city dames,
What can I tell you of these games...
No, never in the blazing flames
With alien to my homeland names,
The glasses tinkled in the frames;
Which should be rhymed with youth extremes?
The fruits of cordial extremes.
Flied by my youthful day’s extremes.
Dusk of the alleys of old limes,
There, at the brook in shade of limes
I used to know the tales of old times,
Of obscure cordial old times,
- What can I tell you, Tanya? Sometimes
Because of them I skipped sometimes
The grudge- by gossip, and sometimes
Who came to the estate sometimes
Should I see you again sometimes?..”
Where he appeared to her sometimes.
He hold me on his hands sometimes,
I hold you on my hands, sometimes!
He looked ridiculous sometimes.
Will never mention it sometimes.
As Sadi used to say sometimes.
Coldblooded lechery sometimes
- Ah, Tanya! Never in these times
The old was busy at all times
As of the sins of youthful times
The Moscow trip to winter times.
She had forsaken in past times,
A company commander comes,
Lions on gates and on high domes
The golden crosses shine on domes.
The Weber’s Freischutz at their homes:
But you, so odd and scattered volumes
Embellished with the paints and rhymes...
But by Torquato octave rhymes
A copybook with touching rhymes
He leaves his sentimental rhymes,
To sacrifice his life for rhymes...
You wrote in secrecy your rhymes,
I declaimed my first novel’s rhymes…
And Bogdanovich’s perfect rhymes.
Depicting by his ardent rhymes
By gossip, tears, rings, weepy rhymes,
The shutters locked, the window panes
The sky is blue, the bright sun shines,
And between all the printed lines
The double lamps of carriage lines
The heroes and the heroines...
Of whom a poet sighs and pines,
The almanacs and magazines,
The men in front; the crowd drones,
One dream will change the other ones,
My thoughts, and feels, and magic tones.
Here is the city of white-stones.
Who now are reaching the gravestones
His style to pompous fashion tunes
To be exposed to blind Fortune’s
The tales of Russian nobles’ fortunes,
For long forgotten evil foes,
And crossing to the table goes.
Back to the blossoms, novels’ heroes,
Examine her from top to toes;
When viewing her from top to toes,
Is worth of overmature apes,
In blossom of the cheerful hopes
To ride horseback in severe steppes?
We were forgetting all the cares,
Delirium and passion flares.
At Lensky stricken Eugene stares.
(The recollection interferes)
The cabmen crowd at the fires,
In front of slowly burning fires
But for the former - hope expires,
I’ve learned the voice of new desires,
By Russian hammers treat the tires
The thirst for goblets still requires
I won’t give up my heart’s adores!
Could I see Russian Terpsichore’s
Could I see Russian Terpsichore’s
And by the stars falls on the shores.
Was born on Neva’s even shores,
How often on Taurida’s shores
Passes poor cabins, gardens, stores,
The hasty letter the love figures.
In vain are all your priceless treasures,
That big wigs value absurd features,
And to expose to them the features
To get a chance to watch your features.
Adorned by the cold beauty’s features
Which people in the country features
It’s time for you, the idle creatures,
The arrogance of haughty creatures,
That carelessness of ardent natures
When viewing her goes into raptures,
Not secret evil fatal tortures
And envy people’s evil tortures.
And save humanity from tortures;
Insensitive to sighs and praises
It’s bursts are worth of highest praises,
And takes a pen to write the verses,
Iambus or trochee in the verses
Had scribbled here the obscene verses.
By chance I have retained these verses
Did search in these nonchalant verses,
You were a subject of my verses,
They harness to the sleigh the horses.
Let’s go.” - The friends jumped on the horses,
And was escorted by the glasses
In a torn caftan, wearing glasses,
Sometimes on Sundays, wearing glasses,
To whom of all these jealous lasses
And she her former master blesses...
The delayed speeches and same dresses,
They start to hug, exchange the kisses
And tell how much each other misses.
The stuff is hilled, babushka crosses,
They were for marriage candidates.
In manor-house congregates
Just that her mind instigates.
Do drag away from city’s gates.
From all the Larina’s estates
The iron bits makes wet and bites,
Since that complies with people’s rites,
The spring attracts to rural sites,
By wish to switch to other sites
There is a lot of pleasant sites”.
Qu' ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;
And absent-minded lorgnettes.
There are no inns and catalogues
Discuss of all Onegin’s virtues
There is no hope! Onegin leaves
Of perished in the autumn leaves
To stain the flighty paper leaves,
Point-blank refuse. She always greaves,
Since people are the customs’ slaves.
Bring to us through the Baltic waves
Eternal deep chorus of waves,
By the creators, whom believes, -
That foolishness a harm conceives,
The ice turns blue, the people hives.
In sleigh by Neva’s bank he drives
And jealous whisper of the wives
But conversations of their wives
To journalists - the public wolves.
Depicts a hero, whom he loves
The parti-colored tiles on stoves.
Then cast at Olga vivid eyes
She didn’t object, tears in the eyes,
And pool the wool over the eyes,
The instant tenderness of eyes,
He read by the spiritual eyes
The tears are close to drop from eyes,
And can’t believe to his own eyes.
And by affected tender eyes
And tried to catch her tender eyes;
With grief and sorrow in her eyes
The tears do stream from Tanya’s eyes.
Is much attractive in my eyes.
Falls on the snow. His hazy eyes
He loves you like your kinfolk, yes!
What I did know, forgotten, yes.
“Tatiana!” - Do you know her? - “Yes,
Just mimics south winter, yes...
Alina, who had read it, yes,
To privatize. Here, I say - Yes!
At these the intent damsel gazes,
The owner of the pauper serfs,
The image of this pair of legs.
Depicted charming females’ legs
The whining skirts and healing prigs.
The fearful tusks and violent fangs,
Thus, tortured by the conscience pangs,
Who all the movements, all the readings
Yet, there were several proceedings,
Diversely repeat same things,
Confide to her the private things,
Gave rise to many silly things,
Who can’t be captured by the feelings,
The always lofty noble feelings,
It makes you sad, calms down feelings.
Two maidens here were moved by feelings.
She used to visit nomads’ dwellings,
It happened in the late time evenings
But now, the pompous neighbor brings
Gets out fast, to his steed springs
A shepherd weaving bast shoe sings
And must arrange the Christmas meetings,
The children’s hold in secret meetings
Noise, laughter, bustle, bows and greetings,
With best regards and other greetings.
There, in the shadow of the wings
A windmill flaps and cracks by wings
Nereids’ unceasing tender songs,
You have forgotten praise for songs,
The bony fingers, bloody tongs,
Such rambling, banal dialogs.
On walls of huts made of the logs
To feign compassion, dose the drugs,
With friends and wife could not hold sighs,
And virgins catch by praise and sighs;
She hands a book in French and sighs.
Tatiana ohhs, and ahhs and sighs,
It’s time of warmth, of works, of sighs,
The chimney gives the final sighs,
Discuss the matter, heave the breaths,
And of my heart so doleful breaths.
The magpies were enjoying this,
A light steam swirling under this.
Was irritated besides this;
And they are painful besides this.
Are you the same? Or other huris
Are you the same? Or other houris
Above their perfect eyebrows is
It breathed and howled and here it is,
There’s plenty neighbors, yes, it is;
What mean deceitfulness it is...
Not understanding what it is,
Glances around and, then, speaks...
Where every line with ardor speaks,
Her voice in dark just sings, not speaks,
And in hush tone to nanny speaks...
The Peter’s Castle with its oaks
Huts, mansions, pharmacies, Cossacks,
He curses women's pranks and tricks,
There’re no such lie or dirty tricks
A hammer at a ramrod nocks,
But in the midst of dismal rocks
Or flaming roses of the cheeks,
The conversations and the talks;
Inexact accent of the talks
With all these jams and nonstop talks
At least the sounds of their talks
A merchant wakes, a pedlar walks,
Remind me my roots and folks.
It’s proud of the Russian folks...
Perhaps sometimes on Neva’s banks
Thus, please, accept my real thanks
But maybe sometimes prayers thanks
I beg for mercy and say thanks!
And fancy looking odds and cranks.
You also saw that breed of cranks.
Who all his glory, cash and ranks
The dish(e)s were served complied with ranks.
I pulled your ears for childish pranks!
The maidens’ secrets and the thinks
Behind a door the cries and clinks,
The hoofs and awful crooked trunks,
Drive tightly packaged bags and trunks
Away. Door opens, Eugene looks,
As well as all infernal spooks,
Didn’t pay attention to her deals,
In an old robe appeared to meals.
Pour out secrets, prays, appeals,
Vladimir writes not madrigals;
Are lightly covered golden coals,
The elite and the fashion models,
I place Tatiana’s vivid feels.
For long disturbs her thoughts and feels.
And very soon the stormy feels
For heart, for fun, for journal quarrels
Ahead, ahead, arrange the travels
The time of joyful tempting revels,
And thunderstorms of midnight revels.
By waving tawdry gown she fails),
In a new bed to sleep she fails,
There are sharp traces of the nails,
Yet, care for beauty of your nails,
On the Caucasian winding trails
The whiskers, horns and crested tails,
By its description in details;
Utters the long-drawn-out wails
And covered by the silky veils
A steam is swirling making coils.
The cupids, demons, snakes and devils
Here a dictator of the balls
He’s playing billiard with two balls.
He steps aside, for people calls.
The royal portraits on the walls,
In dark among the forest’s walls,
The serene brook’s murmuring spills.
Which called us to the night time strolls
Zaretsky Lensky’s body rolls
When being home, he checked the pistols,
The bullets sink in tubes of pistols,
Among the ladies and the girls
Performing by the shy school girls
Unsafe for hearts of virgin girls)
We’ll run off, my sweetheart girls,
Is twinkling, spinning by the whirls,
When will relax heart stirring whirls,
Which differ my and Eugene’s souls.
And pepped up by the vernal beams
The other, cold prosaic dreams,
The disputes, verses, cheerful dreams!
And his Imagination dreams
The secret passions of her dreams,
She animated in her dreams
She’s suffocating... in her dreams
Came true just only in your dreams,
She flied to him in virgin’s dreams,
Whom did you see in your night dreams?”
Of hopes and pranks and pleasant dreams.
Yet, entertained by hollow dreams
The maidens are embraced by dreams,
Where is the pleasure of my dreams,
I think all that is in my dreams...
These fruitless and so gloomy dreams;
By cheery muddy water streams.
And you, the countryside Priams,
Without cards, balls, verses’ rhythms.
Appeared in front of me like phantoms!
And you, superbly looking albums,
Inspiring hopes of local mums.
The mattresses, preserves in cans,
You, Levshin’s school of being fans,
Tabernacles of the barbarians,
Thirty two steps Zaretsky spans;
And in the sky geese caravans
In dreams, card-reading by the maidens,
When semicircles of the gardens,
They are old fashioned specimens.
Of naked birches, ashes, aspens.
Ascends upwards from burning ovens,
A Muscovite, who Harold feigns,
By pencil scribbled words and signs.
Below the others’ words and signs,
Beyond his comprehension signs,
Meaning of dreams and other signs.
To bear the heavy wedlock chains,
In pensive lazy mood remains...
Like a deserted home remains
And with Onegin still remains.
The passion flares and burns and pains,
That was the thing that racked his brains,
To change to wood, pigs’ fat and grains,
From thickets and the backwoods’ cabins..."
And in a squat dance jumps and spins.
They open blinds; smoke by columns
And I complied with crowd’s fashions
It is a place where beaus show fashions,
You came to me in the night visions,
The belfries, churches, booths and mansions
Suffused with laziness and passions,
In bursts of willfulness and passions,
I should prefer against the passions,
Too early he got rid of passions
And thus, the tyranny of passions
To demonstrate their great compassions
A speechless monument to passions,
And he, indifferent to passions,
Revive and ripen in rain’s passions;
And do translate the virgin’s passions
Where are the stormy amorous passions,
Gave up to summer days impressions,
And cherished hopes, and bright impressions,
Your letters and the love expressions.
Into the poetry’s expressions.
And he kept off their noisy sessions
She beat her maids for the omissions
And never asked for spouse permissions.
Unearthly dreams, and sweet delusions,
And sacred poetry’s illusions?
Your voice I heard in my illusions
Hussars come here to spend vacations,
Had left with no clarifications.
I’m glad to note the variations,
What were the tribes negotiations,
These luster, noise and exclamations
Yet, not too firm in estimations,
Zaretsky didn’t need explanations,
He is away from fascinations.
It was right place for declarations,
The other stern considerations
Respect to his exaggerations,
The fruits of vigils, inspirations,
The tragic-nervous demonstrations,
In days of revels and sensations
A special charm in conversations.
And the judicious conversations
Relinquished stormy delectations,
Had left without hesitations,
All matters caused argumentations,
There, Ozerov shared presentations
Of the cold mind’s observations
Belated judgements and reactions, -
Stirred in Eugene just no reactions,
To listen to the same objections,
Manzoni’s and Chamfort’s reflections,
Then on the sheets with recollections,
This one is gnawed by recollections,
He gives to servant the directions...
Onegin with no extra motions,
Without questions or emotions
To agitate high life’s emotions
Destroy the prejudice perceptions,
Who have not learned the being lessons
And never used to give them lessons
He learned sometimes the bitter lessons,
Due to the British poets lessons,
Scapegraces‘ head, tribune of taverns,
He skips and flushing red, then, turns.
And always necessary clowns;
But something happened in the chaos,
And she admires all this chaos,
The one, whose letter he still keeps,
A grove above the river sleeps
With him Tatiana always sleeps,
Or when departing at the steps
A horse can fall when making steps
To kiss Armides’ arousing lips,
Like with no smile the pretty lips,
Puts on a sleigh the frozen corps.
Placed on the table china cups;
Being embraced by fatal fears.
Made blood to still, provoked her fears.
I beg, do terminate my fears.
Anisiya instantly appears,
Didn’t scare at all nobodies’ ears.
Where are the traces of the tears?
The languid glance was full of tears.
My mother implored shedding tears,
In front of you I’m shedding tears,
His parents by the filial tears
I'm still nostalgic, but no tears,
The ladies’ faints and bitter tears
Immature and now faded years,
A magic land! There in old years
A mixture of the ranks and years.
Impresses us three thousand years!
The prejudice of naive years,
Like whirl of passionate young years,
Forgive to fever of young years
That’s how he had killed eight young years,
At least respect to my young years.
The happiness of youthful years
The mysteries of olden years
A naive girl in thirteen years!
And how for long?” - Soon for two years. -
That separated us for years.
But in the late and fruitless years,
What was for him from infant’s years
(It also happened in past years,
That is the same for many years.
Is just the same for many years.
In silence flapping with the oars;
She is alone with moon and stars.
And a superior hero offers
By pawn takes rook, but not of hers.
And how the high society gathers -
How pleased was I to see it, brothers,
The drums are beating waking soldiers.
The countryside and its poor dwellers,
She’s pleased by oligarchic manners
If it would not destroy the manners,
Goes visit all her kindred’s dinners
Obtained the housekeeper’s papers,
All of a sudden Olga enters,
All of a sudden Lensky enters,
Cabmen with faces red like lobsters,
Though, like all other spiteful jesters,
Bukharians, boulevards and cloisters,
The dishes, corks and petty matters.
How careless was in private letters!
A swarm of young unfaithful lovers,
By seeming fears, by oaths and prayers,
And what today, what odd affairs,
Political and state affairs;
A loser in the love affairs,
In recollection love affairs
Full of the pans, and jugs, and chairs,
They shift the glasses, dishes, chairs
They made the first four dreadful stairs,
When she was at the lobby stairs,
They are the greedy boredom’s heirs.
Is full of guests... the friends and neighbors
Along the sleepy corridors
Dismal appearance and pail colors;
To noisy feasts and raving clamors,
To take the keys from entrance doors.
Stood like a picture at the doors,
The servants gather at the doors
Everything casual... the oak floors,
Mistakes in grammar, spelling errors,
To spend in front of tailors’ mirrors,
For the Apollo’s lyre successors,
Nor tubes of fancy connoisseurs
Which, probably, were home of yours,
But neither you, nor friends of yours,
About olden times of yours...
You’ll start to weep, but tears of yours
It is a divine will: I’m yours;
And saying that he drained a glass
Another poet earned success,
Her Moscow cousin, young princess
By stretched on sofa sick princess.
“Pachette!” - Alina, dear Princess! -
It’s what we scarcely would confess.
And maidens’ room; yet, I confess,
A darkened lamp, a desk for chess,
This nook would evidently bless.
All full of him; nonstop and endless
Complied with feelings, purposeless,
It always boils, but is useless.
And yawning calmly and speechless
And yawning calmly and speechless
Of course, it would be pretty fearless,
To write the poems more or less,
Monotonous and always thoughtless,
Of twenty songs at least, not less.
Enamored, simple and artless,
Whose spiteful mind is restless,
Sed alia tempora! Thus, boldness
Her absent-minded passiveness.
The fields attain required freshness,
To give descriptions is my business,
Are pretty tired of the harness.
And in the speeches’ uselessness,
Good by, the faded glory’s witness,
Expect unconscious sweet caress,
Flashing of speeches, ladies’ dress,
The commonwealth can reach a progress,
By pleasing flattery impress,
She’s watching in a sweet distress
It’s youthful trouble - love (I guess)!
I’ll start a poem, then, I guess
Sometimes will finish it, I guess.
It’s not the best age I do guess.
The evening samovar made hiss.
A goblet makes a final hiss,
The forest’s shade and waters’ hiss,
And a dark-eyed blonde’s charming kiss.
Or the long dress’s trim to kiss.
Who’s always perfect, utters bliss,
This Hellespont he swam across,
Provide a shaky baleful cross;
The maids start weeping, people fuss.
A boy served creamer; there’s no fuss;
By one quick foot the other beats.
This fake delusion brings and heats!
And after mother repeats
The lessons of the public treats.
It comforts and the sorrow treats.
From private and all other debts,
Another archly smiled in doubts,
The master to the door directs.
Without palaces and streets,
How it’s majestic sprinkling jets
And, by the way, I note in brackets
She is just blooming! Someday let’s
"Where do you go? These crazy poets!”
She used to bring her magic gifts,
Could value his romantic gifts,
For all, for all your pleasant gifts!
A splinter crackles smokes and lights.
Souls’ inspirations and delights.
Of the seductive springtime nights,
She’s singing, friend of winter nights -
Sometimes aroused the hopeful thoughts,
From here Napoleon lost in thoughts
His head is full of stubborn thoughts;
In stir of stormy reckless thoughts,
Share public’s passions and its thoughts.
The company gets up and waits,
More often, minds of my hermits
At first all neighbors gave him visits,
Used to brine mushrooms and shave recruits,
Both, gorgeous blossoms and sweet fruits.
All stuff that busy London’s merchants
Of rivers, factories and plants,
It entertains the adolescents,
Lyubov Petrovna compliments,
The story rich in sentiments
In vain in diverse entertainments
He saw the faces and adornments,
Don’t hunt for glory’s fake adornments.
Departs, reconciliation moments;
The honey bliss and freedom’s moments...
The dismal jealousy wild torments,
For melancholy, lovely torments,
Having escaped from stormy torments
Thank you for pleasure and enjoyments,
Tatiana in a brief contents
With quite familiar contents.
And boredom of the feast events.
I’d love to write with no restraints.
At a side column with two aunts.
And all my reckless love attempts
My flying poetry’s attempts,
The string is usual... hooded carts
But for the virgin youthful hearts
Her heart is tearing into parts.
The horse when feeling dead man snorts,
And listened to bailiff’s reports,
But at the province town's courts
Among the monsters and the beasts?
About maidens, evil beasts;
For stir, for tempests and for feasts,
Who entertained themselves by feasts.
To all these reckless crazy feasts
In gloomy thoughts her mind rests,
In bed Tatiana half-live rests.
In meek Moldova’s wilds and forests
He swears the uninvited guests;
The hall is crowded with the guests,
Who loves to overwhelm the guests
And at the table to the guests
She does not listen to the guests
Informal family of guests
Welcoming of the coming guests
And they arranged for staying guests
Empting a cup she song to guests,
News, gossips, questions and requests
Of their and other’s amour conquests,
Present their insolence and vests,
Now twists her waist, and now untwists,
And when appeared were met by hosts
Watched how the flame old Moscow bursts.
Nobody hears; the noise and shouts,
But thrifty neighbor was in pouts,
Is it because at high life’s routs
One more thing separated us:
She cannot get relief and, thus,
Was pleased to talk with him and, thus,
The spring gives life to him and, thus,
I’ve honored classicism, and thus,
To go to bed quite soon”. And thus,
I am deprived of that, and thus,
Is just an implement, and thus,
I can’t betray my heart and thus
I should not know of you and thus,
My muddle-headed pupil, thus,
To set and fluff the pillows, thus,
Not often, maybe weekly, thus,
When I was fond of Apuleius
Oh, God, have mercy upon us!
Fluff up the curls and behave gracious,
The oddity, which was unconscious,
Martin Zadeka was the famous,
I am appealing to your nous,
Enjoy your visiting to us,
Which makes a mystery to us,
A feel is absurd thing for us.
Could I again hear your great chorus,
Could I again hear your great chorus,
Hussar Pykhtin had stayed at us;
Do not come to gaze at us,
Why did you come to visit us?
And the grandsons will oust us
But it a paw with sharp long claws
In spring, on Orphic mystic meadows,
The golden fields and blooming meadows,
By ugly bogs replaces meadows;
An uncared park by the thick shadows
Instead of forests we get shadows.
A brook meandering there flows
Flacks of jackdaws and grey-black crows.
Did turn to her from armchair rows.
In front of faded buildings’ rows
Has resurrected nowadays.
Ah, he did love like nowadays
And does it well till nowadays
The roads are awful nowadays,
No more, however, nowadays,
Who dreams and feels like in passed days,
And in his nook spends all the days.
My friends by lassie in those days.
Of my youth’s stormy boiling days
That spring of my galloping days
Being forsaken for long days.
You've spent the treasure of young days,
Both were expecting in young days
My best and happiest young days
She is a friend of my young days,
Inspected field works on weekdays,
I do not blame you... dreadful days...
To my light-headed youthful days!
Enjoyed the baths on Saturdays,
In adolescence’s first days
Alas! The friend for many days,
And probably for many days.
Without elegiac plays,
And of the lyre harmonic plays
And in the childish pranks and plays
Disturb the maidens’ sleeps and plays,
He shared with her the youthful plays.
Farewell to you, the golden plays!
And shuffles cards like faro plays.
And elegized the child’s plays,
Will bring to us these Hymen’s plays,
We both had learned the passions plays...
Fell victim of the passions plays.
Since only poet’s soul still prays
Interpret Say and Bentham essays,
Bed bugs and fleas at the road stays
And where today this glum crank stays,
Are speeding along cobbled roadways,
He stepped aside... and now sideways...
The tired lackeys at the doorways
And opens entrance doors with keys.
Where swans were calling in the valleys,
It was in Lycee’s lovely alleys,
Street lampions, long skirts and boys,
The joyful nation of the boys
Tatiana asked; the helpful boys
The ringing laugh and careless joys.
Look pretty lovely, my good guys!
A half a crane and half a cat.
The maids prefer The Pussy Cat.
By the suggestions hinted at
Forbidden fruit you want to eat,
What can I do! I repeat...
The new - the old ones repeat.
And despite radiant Phoebus threat
Vyazemsky at her took a seat,
Squints at the ladies in box seat;
To quench the cutlets' fiery fat,
But on the whole, their naive chat
Nor boston, nor immodest chat,
Doesn’t understand, what do they chat,
In down and in a peaked hat
It’s time to change the robe and hat.
Which spins inside a reddish hat;
Who is it, in a crimson hat,
In yellow shawl or ladies’ hat!
And finally decided that
Just like the olds established that
Were cursing him this way and that.
- Nobody will be there like that!
(What can you do, they’re all like that).
In secret Tanya pined of that,
It promises; because of that
Onegin didn’t like all of that.
What shall he do with all of that!
Tatiana’s thanks for all of that...
And starts to talk of this of that.
All what Onegin knew of that...
Eating host’s berries doing that
Russo (to mention passing that)
The lilac’s bushes broke and all that
Neglected garden, books, all that
More blessed, who never new all that,
He was so much upset by all that
Till sleepless Breguet rings him that
And maybe tenderly than that.
No doubt, it’s the omen that
No one can comfort her in that.
There is no coquetry in that -
Annoy us less than use to do that
To run away, but can’t do that.
Argue with you, but won’t do that,
All her attention switched to that.
Will be extended, thanks to that
The more attractive, thanks to that
The vice is punished, after that
I’ll force them quarrel, after that
Two minutes later after that
They’ll cock the pistols, after that
And they take pistols after that.
And for a few days after that
Threw down Lensky, after that
Starts to perceive, thanks God for that,
Since morning dressed awaits for that.
A severe punishment for that!
And shall repay to you for that,
A dwarf with tail and besides that
Rejecting nothing; besides that,
Remained quite happy. Blessed is that,
"What’s going on, and where is that,
Enquired gently, who is that,
Proceeds ahead and what is that?
Since loved to touch the carpets that
Declining languid head at that;
And breeding ducks and geese at that
She’s reading epitaph, at that
And what a passions’ storm at that
Who could not see her pain at that!
And whispered both to her at that...
And entertaining books, at that
The countryside’s Cyclops, at that,
(I bet, for sure, you know that),
It stirs her heart, she’s pleased by that.
Of her young plays, and moved by that
Attention to himself by that).
He steps on ice with care, and what?
What caused him wondering and what
He’s at a gathering, and what?
He watched the sun, the clock. And what?
Id est, could prove by means of what
A granny in a quilted coat,
Came in and at the window sat. -
Relying mostly on a debt,
To censor I will pay my debt,
He’ll fascinate you, beyond doubt,
- Oh, my old man, I am in doubt. -
And ladies' legs, but am in doubt,
“All those should be replaced, no doubt.
It’s sonorous and nice, no doubt,
You did see and not once, no doubt,
Yes, in my soul there is no doubt
I’ll be compelled, and that’s no doubt,
But ardent youngsters, it’s no doubt,
To pacify the mind’s doubt,
Will change completely and, in fact,
Who the cold mind can distract,
To call Moina (to attract
What you do have - does not attract,
The theatre starts first ballet act.
So strict in judgment and exact,
And feels of those did not neglect.
But look... ah..! Please, do not neglect. -
To some of these he showed respect,
Full of devotion and respect
The world and husband can suspect
They to the mill their steps direct.
“With pleasure, sweet heart, just direct”.
I won’t amend these or correct.
Shows that this forecast is correct,
The mortal phantoms resurrect -
The endless country intersect.
We know, this book does not depict
And you, the mothers, be more strict
And followed fashions being strict.
And he had found quite distinct...
Teaches to kids the alphabet.
Is insupportable, I bet.
He was not Grandison, I bet.
I am not worth of that, I bet.
Only the family, I bet.
He goes through armchairs, steps on feet,
Onegin dropped at Tanya’s feet.
At home, since barely drag my feet.
That in my rhymes you often meet
And in a drawing room they meet
She sprang from porch the guest to greet
Newcomers; all of them they greet.
Looking light-hearted, nice and sweet
The boy was frisky, but still sweet.
There’s no best award he could get.
If reading this book you could get,
And tries to cry, but fails to get
Where you, a madman, could forget
She couldn’t this awful dream forget.
It is your lunchtime, don’t forget.
To give her lessons in a quiet!
A beetle buzzed. A brook streamed quiet.
Perceiving in the noise and quiet
Seclusion, loneliness and quiet,
I thought that liberty and quiet
But little by little and the quiet
And in the silent idle quiet
The damsels whisper getting quiet;
You, both, in disquiet and in quiet;
Will disappear, leave me in quiet.
They started to approach in quiet
He shed the alive tears in quiet;
Where master used to sit in quiet.
Sleeps dreaming blissfully in quiet.
I was aggressive, he was quiet.
How early he could make disquiet
She’s pale, extinct and always quiet!
The cough and clapping have not quiet.
Like real French, he in his pocket
But pantaloons, frack and gilet,
He brings the dressing gown, and toilet,
In backwoods of forgotten hamlet,
To Tanya brought a famous couplet,
Where you and I first time had met,
In well-arranged seductive net.
Widow Clicquot or famous Moet,
Or even turned to be a poet.
Yes, he resembled quite a poet,
A doleful native so-called poet? -
In frozen bottle for the poet
Did ever any weepy poet
On northern doleful snowy carpet
And after that defame in secret
But then resigned with no regret,
And the old fashioned wig did set.
Sad premonitions does preset,
She’s left. Onegin stays upset,
The uncle’s funeral was set,
Her tender eyes are getting wet.
Her soul is moved, her eyes get wet;
- You have not been presented, yet?
Were poor in Russian language, yet,
No, friends, by Heaven, no one, yet!
Enters a parlor, no one, yet,
Eugene now does not dwell there, yet...
The high life does not like him, yet.
I can’t collect in Russian, yet;
This unexpected passion, yet,
Whoever was my hero, yet,
Not aiming one another, yet,
They have not left the traces, yet,
When he hadn’t learned love tortures, yet,
Cannot resolve misgivings, yet,
Doesn’t want to share her secrets, yet,
He’s found her or not, but, yet,
But I don’t want to praise you, yet,
The next has come - no reply yet.
- Look quickly, darling, to the left. -
The grievous traces he has left.
Instead of feast, instead of gift
A set of scissors, curved and straight,
Her dad was always nice and straight,
Lord Byron’s portrait hanging straight,
The Peter’s Palace. Gee up, straight!
A coachman sits on a cart’s height.
Proudly challenged you to fight?
The others’ sorrow and delight
To high life’s noise and vain delight.
Were all in vain with no delight.
When he spent time in this delight
The balls to me made great delight,
The poet’s raptures first delight,
By soul performed exalted flight?
By soul performed exalted flight?
Unless the star was still in flight.
She suddenly jumps and is in flight,
I’m changing your enchanting light
And at the grave in the moonlight
Starts her way back in the moonlight.
Under a faded dim moonlight
Thus, stormy shade eclipses light
And all what gladdens and gives light,
Without noise, without light,
The other circles fairy light,
Not in your room to spend a night.
The Stars, and Moon, and Magic Night.
Has mixed up morning and midnight
Staying alone the day and night;
In silence all the day and night.
To watch a sick man day and night
A supper follows, say good night,
The beaver collar in the night.
There’re many bright stars in the night,
And all the same, the day, the night...
When above Neva, the white night
Whom dashing cabs at time of night
Bewitched by magic dark of night.
She led me in the dusk of night
Are loaded, and the lamps of night
Invites to visit him tonight.
Three homes invite him for tonight...
And now the day and sleepless night
Like sleeps a newborn, like at night
Intended reading cards at night,
At the main road appears at night.
Like listless visitor by night
You can’t avoid a hungry night.
His lyric tongue was pure and bright,
It is monotonous and bright,
And river’s surface gay and bright
But there’s no star, which is more bright
Of starting day, which looked so bright.
What looks excited and shines bright
Should always be respected, right?
Turned to the alley to the right...
First, listen to me, am I right?
When they bring little notes; all right,
My God! I’ll see her, yes, all right!
I have enjoyed, and that’s all right;
To be expressed in Russian, right
The well-fixed flints are cocked upright;
Yes, he has come ... It’s cleared the sight;
Chronic complain of soul insight,
And when it happened her to sight
The prophecies by the moon’s sight.
The boring pictures only sight
She wore the corsets fitted tight
For an escape, and all for naught.
He did not hurry, since he thought
Only Eugene is in her thought,
Excuse for what he’d done he sought;
That’s what the heart of virgin sought.
By steady, firm and sound gait.
She promptly quickens hasty gait,
Two bullets only now await -
She does not say... I’d better wait,
She falls on snow; the bear doesn’t wait,
To touch a subject quite a bit,
And did not follow the sweet habit,
And heaved a sigh, when he did see it.
To keep a steed and quickly use it
And just like knowing all of it
The husband first reached fatal limit,
Onegin lived like real hermit,
We can’t ignore the public spirit,
She at the table took a sit
And left the other world to visit.
Vladimir Lensky came to visit
We heard of love or knew, what’s it,
Though, listen, Lensky, you can treat it,
Since in that age (you can't deny it)
And said... "You wrote me, don’t deny it,
By exclamations, bread and salt...
By the life habit pretty spoilt,
And shame of vice and other fault,
Reward the singer. Tanya can’t
Politely, like a chilly pedant,
It was a country migrant merchant,
Airy, magnificent and brilliant,
To awful hands of fancy tyrant
You did not find me be pleasant.
His horse scents snow and looking pleasant
It was a noble, even pleasant
He used to be a witness pleasant
The corvee - ancient yoke of peasant
IIt’s winter! And a solemn peasant
And in this very-very instant
He rings a bell; here is his servant -
To pay for post-chaise she didn’t want,
Onegin, patient and indulgent,
But funny stories of the ancient
The mores and manners of the ancient.
To appear proud and obedient,
She’s always modest and obedient,
Riding a steed to bridle obedient,
And to a fiddlestick obedient
He wants show mercy, he’s obedient,
Attentive, listless or convenient!
A tasteful lunch, when it’s convenient,
Got a sincere artless talent,
They stay for long remaining silent,
Two minutes they were staying silent,
At first I wanted to keep silent;
Onegin was as always silent;
Just of my freedom, so repellent,
Now, I feel mounting excitement,
An inexperienced soul’s excitement
Smile of your lips, of the eyes movement
The poet in a flame of judgment
(For this he earns my compliment).
A problematic entertainment
You just came in, and in a moment
She ran around in a moment
I’d love to watch you every moment,
I should not know the bitter torment.
Sick auntie’s cuddles and enjoyment
Thus, people (yes, I do repent)
These pretty legs, and where at present
The poet’s talent could die latent
And thought, what would be its content;
I’m weeping now... But if you haven’t
To sing in chorus to prevent
She’s close to fall into a faint.
“I don't hold you, but, to the point,
Verse Interpretation by Vladimir Balmont
Yes, you are perfect, he has got
Cosmopolite or patriot?
But Tanya weep and cry could not,
And why to play in love should not
In the estate, and why should not?”
- Are you acquainted? - Yes and not.
His home and garden, or shall not.
- No, nanny, nothing, I am not,
Even few seconds she cannot,
To realize that you do not
At the unfinished rhymes does not
Here, a deep snow pulls of a boot
From her so lovely little foot;
Madame de Stael, La Biche, Tissot,
And are you ready to accept
It’s what my soul does not accept;
The serpent does seduce and tempt,
It stirs up blood in withered heart,
It stirs emotions in the heart,
And something sparkled in her heart;
And they will touch somebody’s heart,
She in oblivion tells by heart
Oh, Moscow, you disturbed my heart!
I write and please by that my heart,
This Grandison was brave and smart,
My pen is firm and behaves smart,
When I was staying far apart,
Bassoon and flute at once did start.
In economics was expert,
You shouldn’t deny that in the desert,
And in his nook the sage of desert
Is there a wilderness or desert,
Between beefsteak and cold dissert
Decided to despise the flirt,
A general makes her escort.
The friends’ and enemies’ escort
Caressed in oriental comfort,
The estate manager’s report...
Himself at conscience secret court,
His glance under the table cast,
Instead of bristling up like beast;
And during Russian Shrovetide feast
The scenes of dinners and of feast,
Reminded flighty Venus feast,
The stranger at this giant feast
Three hours he used at least
Calm down burning heart at least.
Look at her shoulders and her breast,
But he will beat for you his breast...
Her breast high raised, the heart beats fast,
Stirred up her soul, her heart beat fast.
He leaves his dwelling place at last,
Restrains with lapse of time, at last,
Though late, prelude is done at last.
And did not die of grief at last.
That resurrected her at last...
And bring eighteen old jades at last.
I won't believe, but is at last
In detail analyze the past,
Young generation of the past
Will be remembering the past?
Will be remembering the past?
The ball is shining in the best.
Which should be all his life’s the best.
Something unclear did suggest,
From here can see and may suggest...
The breath has stopped to leave the chest,
Presentiments constrained her chest.
I’m tired too. Oh, my poor chest!
Where reapers use to play and jest
Preferred to teach him just in jest
To amaze innocence by jest,
I want to be sincere and honest.
Whose feels are absolutely honest.
Tatiana manifests in earnest
To take a brake and have a rest...
The work, the suffer and the rest,
The garden alley, lake and forest?
Night lodging and a place to rest
It’s time for all of us to rest.
Didn’t want to spoil the child’s rest,
It is a place for ploughmen’s rest,
Eighteen eighth calendar, the latest.
Please, heed my voice and sad request...
Please, heed my voice and sad request...
Replies to your hopeless request,
Light movements, lovely voice and waist,
The dark is falling like a mist...
Remember, what did say satirist!
Does foreign fashion cunning lyrist
Her ringlet bashfully to twist
Are whitewashed, there is no more host.
Where is he? God knows. He is lost.
Plus two-three other novels, most
Her eyes now radiate utmost
Siberian severe frost!
Gyaur’s and Juan’s composer, first,
The Moscow youthful Graces, first,
They got in contact and at first
To frighten timid love at first,
She rent her hair and wept, at first,
That’s what she asked the guest at first.
What place he’ll go to visit first?
He noticed languid maiden’s burst,
To dig in prehistoric dust,
But if to be sincere and just,
They used to relish just the lust
Please, be my guard, whom I do trust,
And in the love they did not trust.
Here’s Pradt, and here is Walter Scott.
Like staying always in his hut
Anguish of love drives Tanya out,
When hearing it I think about
And could not stop to think about
What is she dreaming now about?
Why do you now single me out?
And when he wanted to wipe out
And all the lights at once blue out,
In forty would fall ill with gout,
And one of these she’s taking out,
That’s how the country fuss without
In brackets only I mark out
They won’t with malice grin spell out
And always eager to let out
He’d eat, drink, bore, decay, grow stout,
“Good gracious, ma’am! I know way out -
As pretty Finish young girl’s beau!
When used to live and I, and you),
I’ll pray to God, and He will save you! -
Oh, legs, enough to dream of you!
And everywhere in front of you
Just chain of meals in front of you,
By nakedness annoying you.
My modest work. I’ve learned with you
Yet, saying nothing but God damn you,
And though he is unknown to you
And healthy, send regards to you.
I’ll transfer all my rights to you.
Do not make interest to you,
My fortune I entrust to you.
Didn’t make a novelty to you.
Forgive me please. Whatever you
What will you feel, when it was you

They shout... mine! And all guffaw.
But whisper and the fools’ guffaw...
He starts to laugh - and they guffaw,
At the poor virgin; they guffaw,
Change one another... it’s the law
And far niente is my law.
I won’t let toxic worm to gnaw
And with a fear leaned on the paw.
What my light-headed pen did draw,
And isn't this lady he just saw
Thus, make a judgment and review.
The deals and rhymes I shall review.
And to make calming down review
There is your tempter’s fatal view.
Display my fortune to your view...
And don’t depict a gorgeous view.
Who by response, immodest view
To take a stroll? The country view
All that looked to Eugene quite new;
Sometimes she greets him by a bow,
Will still deserve somebody’s bow,
Which twists and runs on a green meadow
She can see neither wood, nor meadow.
On a capacious sunny meadow,
Are you a seeker for a shadow?
“It is Eugene!” And light like shadow,
Which’s covered by the old pines’ shadow.
Along a path in the groves’ shadow
A dawn gets up in chilly shadow,
Rises her up, calls to a window.
The light is shining in the window,
The moon’s twilight is in the window
In learning something and somehow
That the arch person will somehow
But dangled after them somehow;
But no confusion she did show
Should at that time his person show
Erasing inscribed by a blow.
And snow is whirled by sudden blow,
Like fluff produced by Aeolus blow;
The thickets, where my days did flow,
The poet’s soul was still aglow
She shivers with the cheeks aglow,
The cheeks just brighter glow and glow,
It spins and shines, the day starts glow.
That darkness obscures bright day glow.
Want to part with you as a fellow.
To pass for sorrowful odd fellow
A youthful poet and bold fellow
I’d become to him a good fellow,
Eugene Onegin, my good fellow,
Her confidant and native fellow
I glory here my youthful fellow
Enjoy yourself my dear fellow!
A sensitive and tender fellow
Or he is now just decent fellow,
Zaretsky and the honest fellow
A wolf chased by his hungry fellow
It’s calm; under a downy pillow
Sometimes, the common sense could follow,
In dusk of oakery to follow
The decayed fashion do not follow.
Her bow was calm and voice was low.
Expecting to receive bow low;
And has not they converted now
The bullet went through chest and now
That all the rubbish I write now
In golden Italy, I know,
A bashful girl he used to know?
Strains all her hearing just to know
Believe me, you would never know
I have to go, who can it know?”
When waking up he does not know,
It looks like novel’s scene, you know ...”
To strive with him or whom you know
“My prince, please tell me, do you know,
Disturb a dream of my soul now.
I should be better than am now;
Thickets around, dark and snow,
Admired Russian winter, snow
With no preface and just right now
“Not, yet. And when?” - Let’s do it now.
Laugh off and thus escape, but now
However much I’d love you now,
It makes no difficulty now.
But meal is served, and in a row
He lies immovable, his brow
When it’s best time for it to grow”.
Presents the elegies’ rich row,
The shelf, where books were set in row,
Should I fall down punched with arrow,
You’re looking for the same tomorrow.
A, morning beam will flash tomorrow
Of what he’s planning for tomorrow,
Their pastime, meals, plans for tomorrow?
No promise to relax tomorrow.
The other day, today, tomorrow
I read it with a mystic sorrow,
The day and night, delight and sorrow
And stirred by a sincere sorrow
He stretched his arm, and she with sorrow
Who, both, in trouble and in sorrow,
One and the same and well known sorrow,
The time of hopes and tender sorrow,
The habit pacified her sorrow,
His wound with my Tatiana’s sorrow!
Thus, on a shelf he’d set books row
Accept the florid chapters’ row,
No, faithful to the passion’s vow,
They will be glad to meet us. - “Wow!

The reveries like leaves decay.
Please, do not worry, in a day
His life is scheduled for a day,
By phantoms of the vanished day...
Forgotten Tanya of passed day,
And does not play in the midday
To spend in revels night and day?
And shorter had become the day,
At window sitting all the day.
What occupied him all the day
Forestall on balcony the day,
Tatiana’s January name-day!
Where being in a dream one day
It’s nice to check the time of day,
Has vanished with the passing day.
To the beginning of young day.
Thus, they reached Moscow seventh day,
As always eats and drinks all day.
You’ll never hear for a full day
Why are you chasing me today?
- He promised to be here today,
What will he demonstrate today,
With you I drop my tears today,
To speak about yesterday.
Two hearts, maybe, till recent day
I’d love the balls till recent day.
From Romulo to recent day
That shall see you again by day…
And hoarfrost in a sunny day,
And, thus, Tatiana everyday
Met riding horseback every day,
And does it almost every day,
He could be bashful, could be gay,
There is a cabin roofed with hay;
And could drop tears, which were a play!
The former years’ mischief and play.
There came the time for youthful play,
The sleigh rides and a late dawn play,
It’s where I also used to play,
Yes, Satan likes with love to play!
The Olga’s little friends to play,
A vivid day will start to play.
Despite the pain he doesn’t stop play;
His soul did artlessly display,
He stays alone, his hair is gray.
To be so cunning, to betray,
He was not ready to betray
Who’ll never cheat you or betray?
A cup of tea is on the tray.
A lonely private room portray,
And as for Larina, I’d say,
What else you need? Beau monde could say
To be unfaithful, who would say!
The Frenchmen probably would say
You don’t like visits, people say,
It is unbearable, I say,
But that’s enough, enough, I say...
And I got married. Thus, I say,
And only good to you will say?
“He was the Poet!” they will say.
To show good judgment and to say
May at the routs few words say.
In chorus all the grannies say...
- That’s that. He’s killed. - Someone does say.
He tried to talk, but could not say
“This stout general, you say?”
But North is not for me, they say.
Let’s overhear what do they say
Besides the melancholic stay?
To all her kin, though I should stay
Shall fall into the beyond stay.
Like at a peaceful nighttime stay.
This so upsetting private stay,
And used in solitude to stay,
The sleigh now stops. They've come to stay
To take a rest of former stay.
But he is glad that former stay
But Lensky blushed, could not that stay...
And now they’ll separately stay.
In flash can be enticed away...
That’s how in dream we streamed away
Caused by the years, which passed away
The golden youth has passed away!
You’ll never do, it’s passed away;
His pipe to call them from away;
His mother gestures from away.
“Leave me alone, please, go away...”
“I am in love, please, go away”.
Her thoughts are roaming far away,
Watching him from far away,
The relatives from far away
Since got the news from far away...
By fate is taken far away,
He song the countries far away,
Tatiana’s soul flew far away,
Diminishes and goes away,
And fighting pushed the dogs away,
His uncle planned to pass away.
Just idle time to pass away,
He failed to turn sad thoughts away...
Monsieur was fired right away.
Her husband, thus to put away
All his resentment flew away,
“How fast the years do fly away!”
But to continue my life way,
I’ve killed a lot of my life way!
And she was boring all the way.
A black monastic on the way
How dull and boring is the way!
He’s same way meek and deaf same way,
Is slowly trotting in some way.
In search for other novel way,
Meets nobody in a hallway,
From maiden’s room to lobby hallway.
He’s starting pining - still no way.
Neither by chance, nor other way.
Tatiana hopped to a back stairway,
When suddenly somewhere from doorway
In the snowdrifts on Tanya’s way
To take submissively his way!
It speeds; now on a forest way
They’re riding back the shortest way
Captured his mind, anyway,
He’s changed to something, anyway.
From very days of lullaby,
There is no bear, she’s in a lobby.
Like fallow deer when followed by,
But that’s all right, I say good by
A dashing cart is speeding by;
With the young years is slipping by
Where in an estate nearby
When they were strolling nearby,
Hark... snow is squeaking ... passerby;
“But now too late, the time flew by...
And move the desk; I will be ready
But my fate is resolved already!
All of them knew for long already.
He does not go there and is ready
Said briefly that he’s always ready.
I beg your pardon, are you ready,
Tatiana still is calm and steady
Of an unblemished noble lady,
And when a splendid noble lady
But I return to my fair lady.
And could you find in this lady,
Who was to epigrams so greedy
And would be glad to see a body,
Doesn’t try to imitate somebody,
It stiffens, ossifies; nobody
Accompanied by sweetheart body.
Looks like a quiet, easy body,
The guests calmed down... in the study
And in the lonely silent study
Still feel deep sorrow... But should they?
And can recite them, here are they...
Are they the foes?! For how long they
Then liked each other; shortly they
But cannot get rid of the lackey.
Respecting them as boring medley?
She bloomed like lily of the valley,
The moon shy dies away, the valley
Emerging from a nearby valley.
“To whom shall I the note convey?
Could not relax or pacify.
Invited them to clarify...
That’s what she tries to clarify.
Though, it's enough to glorify
Avoids to glance at scary shaggy.
But nowadays the minds are foggy,
And being disarrayed and shy
The damsels tried to look more shy,
She’s given to reflection, shy,
How could it be, she looked so shy!
And feeling braver and less shy
Who was more clever and less shy,
With no restraints, in bloom and healthy?
I glory him!” Yet, not be healthy
- My bosom fellow, are you healthy? -
“The peasants there are rich and wealthy,
How can a state exist and why
Of her beloved, and that is why
Feel feared as well and that is why
Disturbs my stomach, that is why
He is freemason, that is why
As brother’s killer, that is why
And my Zaretsky that is why
He can’t make happy me, that’s why
Reveres the dreamy love, that’s why
And all his oddities, that’s why,
But quitted suddenly, that’s why
But she can’t do it. No? But why?
And I don’t really know why,
The troika tireless, no jerky,
Native automedons are perky,
Than Moon prevailing in the sky.
Her eyes are shining blue like sky;
Illumes this also foolish sky”.
Do stroll under the Finish sky
And when a falling star in sky
Under the Schiller-Goethe’s sky;
The roads in Russia, probably,
You can complain that, probably,
“He’s ignoramus, behaves wildly;
Look at her silently and coldly,
He does not wit by remarks coldly,
Forgive my obscured mind kindly...
Their daughters hug Tatiana fondly.
Yes, Tanya, old, and can’t wit sanely,
My heroine felt sick and lonely.
And only the young girl stands lonely
But not today, though, I sincerely
And trusting to the wife completely
Doesn’t kiss dames’ hands, doesn’t bow politely,
Dispersed still being in a fly,
The country’s idleness calm fly.
For tribute to the fields starts fly.
The wrath of sound mind quickly,
Is she that one Tatiana, really,
"Ah, nanny, nanny! Am I really
Blessed is a modest lover really,
“Do you adore the junior, really?
But time for us will come, yes, really,
He’d learn what human life is really,
I plead to poets... were not really
Oblivion in the high life rally,
Thus, we, today in bloom and silly,
In wilderness, where Eugene only
It’s mine! announced Eugene sternly,
The friend of feasts and melancholy,
The husband loved the sweetheart deeply,
There is no need in gold supply,
“Why yesterday you’d vanished early?”
Blessed is the one, who has left early
At least three balls used to give yearly
According to the seasons, yearly.
(Who judge severely, but fairly)
His father served exactly fairly
According to the rules and neatly,
There are mistakes, if to check neatly;
But hush! You hear? A critic strictly
I have examined written strictly...
And loved to follow the rules strictly.
Like by a down covered lightly.
Since shooting ace from gun he lightly
The guardsmen's spurs are jingling lightly,
The watching eyes are shining brightly.
The valleys dry and blush up brightly.
“I am in love”, - she whispered faintly
His father passed away, and shortly
An uhlan lulled her and quite shortly
Her head is bowed, the eyes blink courtly,
Vladimir was not able, truly,
His gaze is stubborn, he has truly
I do not see here any, truly,
Then puts his hand on chest and slowly
But Larina was dragging slowly,
But tea is served... the maidens slowly
Onegin looks inept and gloomy,
But, then, again reflective, gloomy
That’s how he wrote, inertly, gloomy,
He knew in Latin a good many...
Onegin was by view of many
But we were trapped by destiny
I am worn out... - "Tell me, nanny
Tatiana on advice of nanny
- How poorly you are witting nanny!
“Give me the pen and paper, nanny,
Vladimir answered to the granny.
He’s frosted finger, but it’s funny,
Like at a burial ceremony.
Which his shy daughter did enjoy.
And always biting Shakhovskoy
That they were just a hollow toy.
A lively picture’s pallid copy,
But did it make my Eugene happy,
The others are more odd, more scary...
From the infernal library,
And with no words unnecessary
And kvass like air was necessary,
In many aspects he would vary,
You should control yourself, be wary.
Sometimes I was not too much wary...
And do not hear my wistful cry.
She was afraid, and to her cry
The throe of poetastery,
Thus, every evening at Very
The oily pancakes used to fry.
It irritates and makes me angry;
Being naively nice like fairy,
Being like flighty hope, like fairy,
Who looked so stately and so fairy,
Please, earn the tributes of the glory...
He hasn’t fulfill his dream of glory,
That’s where Didlo was crowned with glory.
Revive Corneille’s dramatic story,
This detrimental captive story?
Who hasn’t read to the end Its story,
Full speed ahead, ahead my story!
A goose’s neck a scull does carry,
And that Vladimir plans to marry
But he was wrong... as always merry
Yes, for the poet you feel sorry...
The question made Vladimir sorry,
Just Tanya’s heart is in a worry...
He only rarely dares to try
To shoot himself he did not try,
To tell her fortune dare not try.
A drive is effortless and easy.
The female cranks of high society!
He showed himself in high society
Some years ago in high society
But enmity in high-society
My beloved Muse to high society,
To demonstrate to high society,
It’s always causes great anxiety
All right, you’re leaving, what a pity.
In style as smart antiquity.
One day, when visiting his aunty,
Here is a ball, there is a party.
“And what?” - Tatiana’s name-day party,
And she was sighing for a guy,
When I was a poetic guy.
Appeared at home starched brazen guy,
Forget your hope forever, guy!
Besides, this old duelist guy
All that, what causes poet’s envy...
Of senseless song, just little breezy.
And Knyazhnin made the public dizzy.

Eugene Onegin
The Novel in Verse
By A.S. Pushkin

Verse Interpretation by Vladimir Balmont

Not for the high life entertaining,
Just being charmed by friendly care,
I’m giving you this bail intending
To reward you more just and fair
By worthy of your lofty feeling
Suffused with consecrated dream
The Poetry serene and living,
The thoughts and ease in high esteem.
But let it be, your care revealing
Accept the florid chapters’ row,
Semi-amusing, semi-wistful,
Ideal, folkish, sometimes blissful,
What my light-headed pen did draw,
The fruits of vigils, inspirations,
Immature and now faded years,
Of the cold mind’s observations
And of my heart so doleful breaths.

Chapter I

I

“My uncle used to be so sound,
But after falling gravely ill
Is craving homage, and has found
That could not make a better deal.
It is for others a good lesson,
But what a boredom is the session...
To watch a sick man day and night
And do not make a step aside!
What mean deceitfulness it is...
To feign compassion, dose the drugs,
To set and fluff the pillows, thus,
To entertain a half deceased,
To show fake sympathy, then, sigh
And think... Oh gosh, when will you die!”

II

It was what a young rake expected,
When dusting post-chaise speeded him,
By Zeus’s supreme will elected
The only heir of all his kin.
The friends of “Ruslan and Lyudmila”!
Here is my novel in verse hero,
With no preface and just right now
Let me acquaint you with the one...
Eugene Onegin, my good fellow,
Was born on Neva’s even shores,
Which, probably, were home of yours,
Or where you used to shine and revel.
It’s where I also used to play,
But North is not for me, they say.

III

His father served exactly fairly
Relying mostly on a debt,
At least three balls used to give yearly
And became bankrupt in the end.
Eugene’s fate, though, was well disposed...
At first, a Madame cared and nursed,
Then, paltry French cared for the kid.
The boy was frisky, but still sweet.
Monsieur l'Abbe was not too formal
Didn’t want to spoil the child’s rest,
Preferred to teach him just in jest
And didn't bore him with strict moral,
Reproved for pranks by gentle talk
To Summer Garden took for walk.

IV

And when the childhood was over,
There came the time for youthful play,
The time of hopes and tender sorrow,
Monsieur was fired right away.
No one restrained Onegin’s passion,
His hair was cut in modern fashion,
Like London dandy he was clothed
And finally had seen beau monde.
He demonstrated perfect bearing...
Could speak good French and wrote as well;
He danced Mazurka very well
And made a bow without straining.
What else you need? Beau monde could say
That he was very nice and sane.

V

Without diligence succeeding
In learning something and somehow
We, thanks to God, can flash with breeding,
It makes no difficulty now.
Onegin was by view of many
(Who judge severely, but fairly)
A scholar, but a prig, as well,
He had a talent, I can tell,
Without straining, simply chatting
To touch a subject quite a bit,
And just like knowing all of it
To remain silent when debating,
And to arose the ladies smile
By sudden epigrams’ brisk style.

VI

Latin today is not high value,
But if to be sincere and just,
He knew in Latin a good many...
The sense of epigraphs could grasp.
From Eneida in his mind
At least two verses he could find.
With Juvenal he was best friend,
Put vale in the letters end.
He didn’t have any inclination
To dig in prehistoric dust,
In detail analyze the past,
But funny stories of the ancient
From Romulo to recent day
He didn’t forget and did retain.

VII

He wasn’t at all a lofty person
To sacrifice his life for rhymes...
Iambus or trochee in the verses
Could never ever recognize.
He reproved greats of Ancient Greece,
By Adam Smith was really pleased,
In economics was expert,
Id est, could prove by means of what
The commonwealth can reach a progress,
How can a state exist and why
There is no need in gold supply,
When it avails a simple produce.
His dad could not that understand,
And put in pawn the estates’ land.

VIII

Discuss of all Onegin’s virtues
(No doubt) will take too much time,
But which of these had made a fortune,
What were his beliefs in the prime?
What was for him from infant’s years
The work, the suffer and the rest,
What occupied him all the day
Besides the melancholic stay?
It was the tender feels inciting
Hymned in the verses by Naso,
The art the poet suffered for,
By which his stormy time was shining;
From beloved Italy exiled
In the Moldova’s steppes he died.

IX X

How young was he to be dissembler,
Feel jealousy and harbor hope,
Persuade, dissuade, and then surrender
To feels, to look like sad or bored,
To appear proud and obedient,
Attentive, listless or convenient!
How was he languishing tightlipped,
And how expressively could speak!
How careless was in private letters!
And when something had stirred his blood
How could give up himself for love!
How fast and tender were his glances!
He could be bashful, could be gay,
And could drop tears, which were a play!

XI

How skillful was he to look modern,
To amaze innocence by jest,
To scare by recklessness a virgin,
By pleasing flattery impress,
To catch a minute of emotion,
To supersede by will and passion
The prejudice of naive years,
Expect unconscious sweet caress,
To pray and call for a confession,
To overhear the first soul’s sigh,
To follow love and in a while
To intercept a lady’s passion,
And later in a lonely site
To give her lessons in a quiet!

XII

How early he could make disquiet
A heart of regular coquette!
And when he wanted to wipe out
The rivals standing on his path,
How awfully caustic he was!
What artful nets he spread for those!
But you, the husbands, were so kind
That friendship with him did not mind...
He was caressed by cunning spouse -
Faublas’s old-established friend,
And a suspicious old man,
And cuckold, who looks always nice,
Is proud of his style of life,
His copious dinner and his wife.

XIII XIV XV

Sometimes, he used in bed still staying,
When they bring little notes; all right,
The invitations, they are saying
Three homes invite him for tonight...
Here is a ball, there is a party.
Where will proceed my naughty partner?
What place he’ll go to visit first?
He’ll manage all of it, of course.
And so far in a morning clothing,
In a wide hat la Bolivar
Onegin drives to boulevard,
And in the open air keeps strolling
Till sleepless Breguet rings him that
It is your lunchtime, don’t forget.

XVI

It’s getting dark, he went sleigh riding,
“Gee up” - the eager cabman cried;
With frosty silver dust was shining
The beaver collar in the night.
He dashed to chef Talon aware
Kaverin was awaiting there.
Gets in, - a cork with pop springs up,
And wine like comet jets to cup,
Here is a roast beef’s bloodstained slice,
And truffles - splendor for the youth,
French cuisine the highest proof,
And Strasburg pie so neatly lies
Between a slice of Limburg cheese
And a pineapple golden piece.

XVII

The thirst for goblets still requires
To quench the cutlets' fiery fat,
But Breguet watch’s bell reminds...
The theatre starts first ballet act.
The stage’s vicious fashion maker,
The charming actresses’ caretaker,
The well-known youthful theatre sage
And honored dweller of backstage,
Onegin speeded to the theatre,
Where everyone feels free and sage
To hiss an actor off the stage,
To catcall Ph(a)edra, Cleopatra,
To call Moina (to attract
Attention to himself by that).

XVIII

A magic land! There in old years
The freedom’s potentate Fonvisin
His satire plays with triumph staged,
And Knyazhnin made the public dizzy.
There, Ozerov shared presentations
Of people’s tears and clapping splashes
With young Semenova; just there
Appeared Katenin and did dare
Revive Corneille’s dramatic story,
And always biting Shakhovskoy
Became the comedies le roi;
That’s where Didlo was crowned with glory.
There, in the shadow of the wings
Flied by my youthful day’s extremes.

XIX

My goddesses! How are you doing?
Please, heed my voice and sad request...
Are you the same? Or other houris
Have occupied on stage your place?
Could I again hear your great chorus,
Could I see Russian Terpsichore’s
By soul performed exalted flight?
Or dismal glance will fail to find
On the dull stage the well-known faces,
And watching through lorgnette the world
I’ll be bystander sad and cold,
Indifferent to the new graces,
And yawning calmly and speechless
Will be remembering the past?

My goddesses! How are you doing?
Please, heed my voice and sad request...
Are you the same? Or other huris
Have occupied on stage your place?
Could I again hear your great chorus,
Could I see Russian Terpsichore’s
By soul performed exalted flight?
Or dismal glance will fail to find
On the dull stage the well-known faces,
And watching through lorgnette the world
I’ll be bystander sad and cold,
Indifferent to the new graces,
And yawning calmly and speechless
Will be remembering the past?

XX

The hall is full, the boxes flashing,
The stalls and armchairs are in boil,
The circle top with clapping splashes,
A curtain rustles in a whirl.
Airy, magnificent and brilliant,
And to a fiddlestick obedient
Istomina stands in a crowd
Of nymphs, who make a nice background.
One of her feet touches the floor,
The other circles fairy light,
She suddenly jumps and is in flight,
Like fluff produced by Aeolus blow;
Now twists her waist, and now untwists,
By one quick foot the other beats.

XXI

All clapping. Here’s Onegin coming,
He goes through armchairs, steps on feet,
And his lorgnette aside aligning
Squints at the ladies in box seat;
The theatre tiers glancing over
He saw the faces and adornments,
Disliked these awfully, and then
Exchanged the bows with sitting men,
Glanced at the stage and all around,
And doing it with vacant look
Averted, yawned and did conclude...
“All those should be replaced, no doubt.
Ballets awake in me just bore,
Didlo doesn’t stir me anymore”.

XXII

The cupids, demons, snakes and devils
Still jump all over and make noise.
The tired lackeys at the doorways
Right on the fur coats are in drowse.
The footfall hasn’t, yet, pacified,
The cough and clapping have not quiet.
Inside and out of the theatre
The lamps are lighting by a glitter.
The horses thrashing in the cold
Are pretty tired of the harness.
The cabmen crowd at the fires,
Clap hands and idle masters scold.
Onegin now is getting off,
He forwards home to change the cloth.

XXIII

Can I depict my true impression,
A lonely private room portray,
Where foster child of the fashion
Was dressed, undressed and dressed again?
All stuff that busy London’s merchants
To agitate high life’s emotions
Bring to us through the Baltic waves
To change to wood, pigs’ fat and grains,
All what in Paris hungry taste
Invents for fun according fashion,
Promoting splendid life impression
To drive the trade, and that makes sense,
All that the study room adorned,
And to eighteen years sage belonged.

XXIV

Pipes’ amber from Constantinople,
Bronze on the table, chinaware,
Perfume in stylish cut-glass bottle
(A pleasure for effete young man),
Steel files for nails and combs for hair,
A set of scissors, curved and straight,
The brushes more than thirty breeds
To polish nails and brush the teeth.
Russo (to mention passing that)
Got really mad, when pompous Grim
Dared polish nails in front of him,
Romantic eloquent madcap.
The liberty and rights defender
This time was wrong that way to render.

XXV

You can be a pragmatic person,
Yet, care for beauty of your nails,
To cite against looks controversial,
Since people are the customs’ slaves.
Chadaev’s copy, my Onegin,
Being afraid of jealous blaming,
When choosing clothing was a prig
And followed fashions being strict.
Three hours he used at least
To spend in front of tailors’ mirrors,
And his from fitting room appearance
Reminded flighty Venus feast,
When she in menswear being clothed
To masquerade drives from abroad.

XXVI

I have attracted your attention
To his attires in last taste
And planned to show the modern fashion
By its description in details;
Of course, it would be pretty fearless,
To give descriptions is my business,
But pantaloons, frack and gilet,
I can’t collect in Russian, yet;
And I confess to you with shame
That my, besides all that, poor style
I am diluting time to time
With alien to my homeland names,
Though, in the past I used to glance
Over the lexicon not once.

XXVII

But now it’s not right thing to purpose,
We’d better gallop to a ball,
Where after changing of the clothes
Onegin speeded after all.
In front of faded buildings’ rows
Along the sleepy corridors
The double lamps of carriage lines
Pour out light and cheer the minds,
And rainbow on the snow induce.
The lampions shine all around,
A mansion glitters on a ground.
In windows shadows are produced
By moving heads of noble dames
And fancy looking odds and cranks.

XXVIII

Here is my hero at the entrance,
He passed a doorman in a rush,
Flied up the marble steps of staircase
And fixed his hair by fingers brush.
He gets into the crowded hall,
The music tiers to make roar,
Mazurka entertains the crowd
The noise and crush are all around.
The guardsmen's spurs are jingling lightly,
The flying feet of dancing dames
Leave in the air a charming trace,
The watching eyes are shining brightly.
And jealous whisper of the wives
Dies in the violins’ roars and cries.

XXIX

In days of revels and sensations
The balls to me made great delight,
It was right place for declarations,
For handing letters perfect site.
Oh, you, an honorable spouse!
I am appealing to your nous,
Please, listen to me and be wise,
I call you to oppose the vice.
And you, the mothers, be more strict
And to your daughters pay attention,
Keep your lorgnette at right direction,
Or, what can be? ... Oh, God forbid!
I write these lines one reason for,
Since I am not a sinner more.

XXX

In vain in diverse entertainments
I’ve killed a lot of my life way!
If it would not destroy the manners,
I’d love the balls till recent day.
I love this youthful animation,
And cram, and shine and exaltation,
And dames’ attire, smart and proud,
And ladies' legs, but am in doubt,
Since scarcely in the Russian lands
Three pairs of slender legs you’ll find.
Oh! How for long disturbed my mind
The image of this pair of legs.
And their seductive figuration
Till now disturbs imagination.

XXXI

Is there a wilderness or desert,
Where you, a madman, could forget
These pretty legs, and where at present
On vernal flowers they step?
Caressed in oriental comfort,
On northern doleful snowy carpet
They have not left the traces, yet,
Since loved to touch the carpets that
Were soft exciting lavish pleasure.
Because of them I skipped sometimes
The thirst for glory and for prize,
The land of fathers, freedoms’ treasure!
The happiness of youthful years
Has disappeared like their light trace.

XXXII

Diana’s breast and cheeks of Flora
Look pretty lovely, my good guys!
But Terpsichore’s cute leg, however,
Is much attractive in my eyes.
It presages to covert gaze
Inestimable sensual praise,
It does attract by pleasant form
The willful passions in a swarm.
Yes, I do love it, my Elvina,
When hidden under table cloth,
In spring, when stepping on greensward,
In winter time, when ballerina
Steps on the stage, on parquet floor,
And at a see shore on rock wall.

XXXIII

I saw the sea before storm coming...
What envy was aroused in me,
When after speedy heady running
The waves did drop at feet of thee!
With waves I was embraced by feeling,
To touch cute legs my lips were willing!
No, never in the blazing flames
Of my youth’s stormy boiling days
I ever wished it with such passion
To kiss Armides’ arousing lips,
Or flaming roses of the cheeks,
Or breast stirred up by love expression.
No, never ever passions’ whirl
Was so much rankling in my soul!

XXXIV

I cannot leave this in behind,
It’s where my cherished dream extends...
A happy stirrup in my mind...
I’m feeling female’s leg in hands!
Again the fantasy is boiling,
Again this touch of leg is burning,
It stirs up blood in withered heart,
Again this anguish and this love!
Though, it's enough to glorify
The arrogance of haughty creatures,
They are not worthy of these speeches,
I’d better still my chatty lyre.
These enchantresses’ words and glances
Are so deceptive... like feet’s traces!

XXXV

Where is Onegin? Half asleep,
From ball to bed he’s moved by carriage.
St. Petersburg does never sleep,
The drums are beating waking soldiers.
A merchant wakes, a pedlar walks,
A cab to stand is pulled by horse,
A dairymaid delivers milk,
Under her feet the snow makes squeak.
The morning noise refreshes air.
They open blinds; smoke by columns
Ascends upwards from burning ovens,
A baker - German, clean and fair,
In paper cap, exclaimed not once
His crackling language's was ist das.

XXXVI

But being worn by night time pleasure,
Has mixed up morning and midnight
The kid of luxury and leisure
Sleeps dreaming blissfully in quiet.
Gets up in p.m., and again
His life is scheduled for a day,
It is monotonous and bright,
And all the same, the day, the night...
But did it make my Eugene happy,
When he spent time in this delight
Triumphing victories and pride,
With no restraints, in bloom and healthy?
Or it is fruitless and in vain
To spend in revels night and day?

XXXVII

Too early he got rid of passions
And was annoyed with high life’s roar;
The beauties drew no more attention
And did not stir him anymore.
Unfaithfulness made him fatigued,
Of friends and friendship he got rid,
Since not for long he could and would
Eat beef-steaks and the Strasburg food
Spill with Champaign straight from a bottle,
And pour the spicy bitter words,
When at that time headache disturbs;
And though he loved the life to throttle,
He ceased to like it in the end -
The fight, the saber and the lead.

XXXVIII

A sickness of an unknown kind,
Which should be cleared long time ago
(It somehow English spleen reminds
And is khandra in Russian term),
Had seized him little at a time.
To shoot himself he did not try,
And thank you, God, for the assistance,
But he cooled off routine existence.
He showed himself in high society
Like Child Harold sullen, sad,
Nor boston, nor immodest chat,
Nor sigh or glance could now excite him,
No, nothing could awake his soul,
He was ignoring the whole world.

XXXIX XL XLI XLII

The female cranks of high society!
You were the first whom he ignored;
Since in that age (you can't deny it)
The high tone makes us pretty bored.
It happens, though, some noble ladies
Interpret Say and Bentham essays,
But on the whole, their naive chat
Is insupportable, I bet.
Besides, they are so chaste and pure,
So strict in judgment and exact,
Full of devotion and respect
That make me feeling sick and poor.
In front of them I feel so mean,
Just viewing those produces spleen.

XLIII

And you, young pretties (not the ladies),
Whom dashing cabs at time of night
Are speeding along cobbled roadways,
Onegin them as well declined,
Had left without hesitations,
Relinquished stormy delectations,
Decided to stay home alone;
Then took a pen and stifling yawn
He wished to write, but patient labor
Arose in him aversion, so
His pen had grasped nothing at all,
And guild of writers was disfavored.
I cannot judge of those because
I by myself belong to those.

XLIV

And then, anew, as always idle
And being by a void depressed
He tried this time the others' mind
To privatize. Here, I say - Yes!
Thus, on a shelf he’d set books row
And tried to read them, but what for?
Here’s boredom, there is fraud or lie,
Here - lack of conscious, there - poor style,
And all of them are far from freemen.
The old ones look quite obsolete,
The new - the old ones repeat.
Thus, he’d left books like did with women,
The shelf, where books were set in row,
He covered with taffeta cloth.

XLV

When I’d got rid of public burden
And like Onegin left world’s vain,
I’d become to him a good fellow,
Because his features pleased my brain...
To dreams spontaneous devotion,
The oddity, which was unconscious,
And sharp and ice cold style of mind.
I was aggressive, he was quiet.
We both had learned the passions plays...
We both of life were pretty tired,
In both the flame in heart had died,
Both were expecting in young days
To be exposed to blind Fortune’s
And envy people’s evil tortures.

XLVI

He, who did live and used to reason,
Cannot avoid despise to men,
He, who did feel, he is imprisoned
By phantoms of the vanished day...
He is away from fascinations.
This one is gnawed by recollections,
That - by repentance occupied,
And that is why we often find
A special charm in conversations.
At first, Onegin’s language was
Annoying to me, then, did cause
Respect to his exaggerations,
Jokes impregnated with the bile
And biting epigrams’ harsh style.

XLVII

How often in a summer season,
When above Neva, the white night
Appeared like light majestic vision,
And river’s surface gay and bright
Did not display the moon reflection,
In former passions recollection,
In recollection love affairs
We were forgetting all the cares,
And by the well-disposed night’s breathing
We were so speechlessly bewitched!
Like sleepy convict being switched
From calaboose to forest greening,
That’s how in dream we streamed away
To the beginning of young day.

XLVIII

With soul embraced by sorrow feeling
And leaning on a granite shelf
Onegin stood immersed in dreaming
As Poet had portrayed himself.
Allover silence, in the distance
The sentries’ calls recalled existence;
The sounds of a cab wheel rumble
Disturbed the calm all of a sudden.
A boat was gliding dozing river
In silence flapping with the oars;
A shepherd horn broke in the drowse,
And dashing song of remote singer...
But by Torquato octave rhymes
Grant to me even more surprise!

XLIX

Oh, Brenta, Adriatic spaces,
I wish to cast at you my glance!
And hearing your majestic splashes
Will animate my soul at once!
For the Apollo’s lyre successors,
Due to the British poets lessons,
You are familiar, my own.
In golden Italy, I know,
At liberty I’ll play and revel,
With young Venetian spend time.
She’ll chat and hush then for a while.
In mystic gondola we’ll travel.
And thanks to that I shall acquire
The love’s and Petrarch’s tongue and lyre.

L

Would ever I hear freedom chiming?
It’s time, it’s time! - I want be free!
I stroll by sea shore weather minding
And beckon boats' sails in the sea.
When shall I leave this boring order?
Clothed by the storms with waves I’ll quarrel,
And run to unrestricted span.
It’s time to leave the boring land,
The elements to me unpleasing,
And in the midday’s wavy space -
In Africa, my old folk’s place,
To sigh of gloomy Russian being,
Of where I suffered, where I loved,
And where my heart I’ve given up.

LI

Onegin was prepared with me
To see the world and change the place,
But we were trapped by destiny
That separated us for years.
His father passed away, and shortly
A regiment of lenders brought him
A lot of papers, which required
How to escape from debts to find.
Onegin hated litigation
And, by his fortune satisfied,
Let them the heirloom to divide
And did it with no hesitation,
Since got the news from far away...
His uncle planned to pass away.

LII

He’d really got all of a sudden
The estate manager’s report...
His uncle wants to say last pardon,
He’ll shortly leave the naughty world.
Had read this sad and grievous letter
Onegin didn’t postpone the matter
And started dashing headlong race
Beforehand yawning in post-chase,
And, as I told in the beginning,
To suffer for the money sake
The sighs, and tedium, and fake.
But when he’d reached the one who’s leaving,
He’d seized him on a table worth
To be a tribute to the earth.

LIII

The stead was full of the complaisance;
Who liked the deceased and disliked
To demonstrate their great compassions
Came visit the burial site.
The uncle’s funeral was set,
The priests and neighbors drank and ate,
And after left with solemn words,
Like being busy afterwards.
Eugene is now the only owner
Of many peasants, forests, lands,
Of rivers, factories and plants,
He, who was order’s foe and squander,
But he is glad that former stay
He’s changed to something, anyway.

LIV

Two days he found it quite novel...
To watch remoteness of the fields,
In dusk of oakery to follow
The serene brook’s murmuring spills.
But on the third day of the staying
All that didn’t look so entertaining;
Then, all this bliss made him asleep,
And he had found quite distinct...
The country is same boredom, though,
Without palaces and streets,
Without cards, balls, verses’ rhythms.
Khandra affects him overall,
And it will chase him all his life,
Like shadow or a faithful wife.

LV

I was conceived for peaceful being,
For country’s fascinating calm,
The more in thickets, better hearing
Of lyre’s creative tongue and charm.
I stroll by a deserted lake
By naive pastime entertained,
And far niente is my law.
Each morning I am waking for
The honey bliss and freedom’s moments...
I read not much and sleep for long
And like I did in days of old
Don’t hunt for glory’s fake adornments.
My best and happiest young days
I spent in idleness in shades.

LVI

The country, flowers, field spaces,
Love, idleness - I adore those!
I’m glad to note the variations,
Which differ my and Eugene’s souls.
I do not want a mocking reader
Or other literature figure
Composing intricate blackwash
Collate Onegin with me, gosh,
Forgetting shame claim it wherever
That a self-portrait I did write,
Like Byron, poet of the pride,
And am not able, never ever,
To write the poems more or less,
But of myself and nothing else.

LVII

And by the way, the poet’s mind
Reveres the dreamy love, that’s why
The lovely things, I used to find,
Appeared to me in dreams, and I
These covert images retained,
And let my Muse to animate...
Thus, highland virgin I did praise,
Who drew me to a great amaze,
And captives of the Salgir river...
And nowadays from you, my dear,
A frequent question I do hear...
“Who now arouses your lyre’s fever?
To whom of all these jealous lasses
You dedicated your lyre’s graces?

LVIII

Whose gaze, exiting inspiration,
By sweet caress had made a prize
For your poetic meditation?
Whom did your verses idolize?”
No, friends, by Heaven, no one, yet!
And all my reckless love attempts
Were all in vain with no delight.
These poets blissful, who combined
Both, love and rhythms and by that doubled
The sacred poetry delire
Recalling the great Petrarch’s lyre,
And by the heartache not more troubled
Caught fame and glory by God’s will.
But I in love was dumb and still.

LIX

My Muse had come, when love expired,
She broke the obscured mind’s bonds.
I’m free again, want to combine
My thoughts, and feels, and magic tones.
I write and please by that my heart,
My pen is firm and behaves smart,
At the unfinished rhymes does not
Draw female's legs, heads and so forth;
Extinguished ash will not make fire,
I'm still nostalgic, but no tears,
And very soon the stormy feels
Will disappear, leave me in quiet.
I’ll start a poem, then, I guess
Of twenty songs at least, not less.

LX

I built the plot of my new novel
And thought, what would be its content;
And now a page you’re turning over,
Where is first chapter’s very end.
I have examined written strictly...
There are mistakes, if to check neatly;
I won’t amend these or correct.
To censor I will pay my debt,
And, then, present it for reviewing
To journalists - the public wolves.
I beg, my newborn creature, move
To Neva’s banks for public viewing!
Please, earn the tributes of the glory...
The idle talks, clamor and quarrel!


Chapter II

I

The country, where Eugene was boring,
Was a scenic and charming place;
The one, who’s innocence enjoying,
This nook would evidently bless.
The landlord solitary dwelling
Above a creek was quietly laying
Under the lee of a small hill,
In front of it a lovely scene...
The golden fields and blooming meadows,
The villages dropped here and there,
The flocking herds and country air;
An uncared park by the thick shadows
Extended far away its spreads -
A pensive shelter for Dryads.

II

A worthy mansion was erected
As for the castles it should be...
Perfectly durable and tranquil,
In style as smart antiquity.
The lofty chambers all around,
Damask wallpaper in the parlor,
The royal portraits on the walls,
The parti-colored tiles on stoves.
All that has now dilapidated,
And I don’t really know why,
So far as for the friend of mine,
He wasn’t at all by that affected,
Since he was yawning when he strolled
Both, modern room and ancient hall.

III


He’d settled in the mansion’s chamber,
Where the old timer for great whiles
With housekeeper used to ramble,
Sat at a window and crushed flies.
Everything casual... the oak floors,
The table, sofa, two cupboards,
And not a speck of ink, do note.
Onegin opened one cupboard -
Obtained the housekeeper’s papers,
The other one - the bottles line,
A row of jugs with apple wine,
Eighteen eighth calendar, the latest.
The old was busy at all times
And other books didn’t recognize.

IV

Onegin bored, and then decided,
Just idle time to pass away,
To change routine and thus provided
A reformation in estate.
And in his nook the sage of desert
The corvee - ancient yoke of peasant
By easy quitrent had replaced,
And serf had blessed the divine grace.
But thrifty neighbor was in pouts,
Suspecting in it a great harm
To his hereditary farm,
Another archly smiled in doubts,
And all of them made a conclusion
That he is awfully unusual.

V

At first all neighbors gave him visits,
But since he used at the back porch
To keep a steed and quickly use it
Just hearing an approaching coach,
It did not make the neighbors glad,
Some of them really got mad,
And they all stopped attempts to deal
And even keep in touch with him.
“He’s ignoramus, behaves wildly;
He is freemason, that is why
Drinks from a tumbler just red wine;
Doesn’t kiss dames’ hands, doesn’t bow politely,
Dose not say yes, ma’am, or no, sir,
But always simply yes or no”.

VI

It’d happened that another landlord
At the same time nearby arrived
And to the same conformist neighbor
A cause for gossip did provide.
Vladimir Lensky was his name,
With soul like born in Gottingen,
A handsome in the prime of life,
A poet, and with Kant in love.
In misty Germany he’d borrowed
The elevated expertise...
The freedom-loving reveries,
An ardent spirit (quite uncommon),
Rhapsodic manor of the talk,
And the black curls to shoulders long.

VII

He was too young to be depraved
By high society’s dissipation,
His soul was warmed up by the care
Of friends and maidens’ adoration.
At heart an ignorant naive,
He cherished hope and was deceived
By the new world’s uproar and shine
That still imprisoned his young mind.
He entertained his soul by dreaming
To pacify the mind’s doubt,
And could not stop to think about
The purpose of the human being.
That was the thing that racked his brains,
And he perceived the magic tales.

VIII

And he believed, there is a soul,
Which’s of a similar communion,
And languishing it’s searching for
The one with whom would make a union,
That friends would prefer shackles bearing
Than let someone his name defaming,
And none of them would ever waver
To smash a vessel of a slander;
That there are chosen by the fortune
The people’s sacramental friends,
Someday they’ll get the magic brands
And save humanity from tortures;
The world will stay in pleasant tranquil,
And people will be for that thankful.

IX

Regret, deep sorrow, indignation
And for the glory honey craving
Alike stirred his blood agitation,
Since young enkindled his soul flaming.
He wandered in the world with lyre
Under the Schiller-Goethe’s sky;
And their creative Muses’ blaze
Had brought his soul into amaze.
The elevated Muses’ lyrics
He, being lucky man, maintained,
And in his songs with pride retained
The always lofty noble feelings,
The impulses of virgin dream
And charming ease in high esteem.

X

He song the love to love devoted,
His lyric tongue was pure and bright,
Like dreams a virgin openhearted,
Like sleeps a newborn, like at night
The Luna in the sky is shining,
Goddess of mystery and sighing.
He song sad parting and deplored
An obscured something in remote.
Romantic roses glorifying
He song the countries far away,
Where being in a dream one day
He shed the alive tears in quiet;
He song the withered being cold
And was not, yet, eighteen years old.

XI

In wilderness, where Eugene only
Could value his romantic gifts,
He didn’t like visit local landlords,
Who entertained themselves by feasts.
And he kept off their noisy sessions
And the judicious conversations
About haying, taste of wine,
About dogs and kin of mine.
They didn’t excel neither by feeling,
Nor by poetic charming flame,
Neither by wittiness of brain,
Nor by the art of common living.
But conversations of their wives
Were even worse and much less wise.

XII

Vladimir being rich and handsome
Was cared as bridegroom candidate,
It is a countrymen’s convention...
Search for a daughter a good mate.
He just comes in and is attacked
By the suggestions hinted at
The boredom of unmarried life
And pleasantness of a nice wife.
They call him to a samovar,
Where Dunya pours a cup of tea,
They whisper... “Dunya, do you see!"
And after bring her a guitar...
And she begins to squeak (my God!)
Come to my chamber made of gold!

XIII

But Lensky not at all desired
To bear the heavy wedlock chains,
And was sincerely inspired
With my Onegin to make friends.
What distance is from ice to flame,
From prose to verse, from rock to wave?
Nothing could differ more than those!
They got in contact and at first
Both bored when gathering together,
Then liked each other; shortly they
Met riding horseback every day,
Stroke up close friendship just forever.
Thus, people (yes, I do repent)
Of doing nothing get a friend.

XIV

But what is friendship? We consider
(Denying prejudice as fake)
The friends as just an added zero,
I am a figure of high rank.
I’ll be Napoleon, no kidding;
And any other human being,
Is just an implement, and thus,
A feel is absurd thing for us.
Onegin had more just perception;
Yes, he had learned the people well,
In general despised all them,
But (are there rules with no exception?)
To some of these he showed respect,
And feels of those did not neglect.

XV

Thus, Lensky’s speech evoked his smile.
The poet’s flaming conversation,
Inspired gaze and mind’s style,
Yet, not too firm in estimations,
All that looked to Eugene quite new;
And to make calming down review
He did not hurry, since he thought
That it is not too smart to stop
This minute-long gushing existence.
Let him, so far, in that believe
And with that faith in life still live;
It’ll stop without my assistance.
Forgive to fever of young years
Delirium and passion flares.

XVI

All matters caused argumentations,
Invited them to clarify...
What were the tribes negotiations,
The fruits of learning, truth and lie?
The superstitions centuries old,
The coffin mysteries dead cold,
The fate and life were analyzed,
Severely judged and criticized.
The poet in a flame of judgment
Read in oblivion time to time
The extracts from a northern rhyme,
Onegin, patient and indulgent,
Though could not catch it in detail,
Tried to perceive the youngster's tale..

XVII

More often, minds of my hermits
Were by the passions entertained;
Having escaped from stormy torments
Onegin usually conveyed
These talks with sighs of consolation.
Blessed is who witted exaltation,
But then resigned with no regret,
More blessed, who never new all that,
Who chilled his love by a departure,
The grudge- by gossip, and sometimes
With friends and wife could not hold sighs,
Who never suffered jealous torture,
Who did not play and never tried
His grandpa’s wealth to deuce confide.

XVIII

When we shall resort at a banner
Of wise and reasonable calm,
When passions and excitement fever
Will die, and we shall see just fun
In bursts of willfulness and passions,
Belated judgements and reactions, -
Not free of efforts and submissive
We, sometimes, would prefer to listen
To others’ rebel passions whirling.
It stirs emotions in the heart,
Like staying always in his hut
An olden crippled man is turning
Attention to the young men’s tales
Being forsaken for long days.

XIX

But ardent youngsters, it’s no doubt,
Are never ready to conceal
And always eager to let out
Their love, or grief, or other feel.
A loser in the love affairs,
Onegin heard with a stern face
Sincere cordial confession,
The ardent poet’s self-expression;
Vladimir, when in exaltation,
His soul did artlessly display,
Onegin shortly was aware
Of all his feels and adoration -
The story rich in sentiments
With quite familiar contents.

XX

Ah, he did love like nowadays
Nobody by love can be blessed,
Since only poet’s soul still prays
To love and feels its real taste.
Wherever, always the same dreaming,
One and the same familiar feeling,
One and the same and well known sorrow,
No promise to relax tomorrow.
Neither long years of separation,
Nor fell into poetic trance,
Nor beauties of a far off place,
Nor learning fruits, nor inspiration
Could change his soul, the same desire
Was heating it by virgin fire.

XXI

To Olga since the adolescence,
When he hadn’t learned love tortures, yet,
He used to be a witness pleasant
Of her young plays, and moved by that
In leafy forest’s saving shades
He shared with her the youthful plays.
For neighbors, friends and both their dads
They were for marriage candidates.
Being naively nice like fairy,
In wilderness, in charming calm,
And by the view of dad and mum
She bloomed like lily of the valley,
Which was not touched in grass’s wilds
Neither by bees nor butterflies.

XXII

She was that one who had inspired
The poet’s raptures first delight,
And animated in his mind
The virgin moan of dreaming pipe.
Farewell to you, the golden plays!
He fell in love with forests’ shades,
Seclusion, loneliness and quiet,
The Stars, and Moon, and Magic Night.
The Moon - night sky illumination,
Which called us to the night time strolls
In dark among the forest’s walls,
Provoked the tears, brought consolation...
But now, when looking at its face,
We think, you’re nice, since lamp replace.

XXIII

She’s always modest and obedient,
And cheery like a morning rise,
With open heart, like poet’s being,
Like kiss of love is sweet and nice.
Her eyes are shining blue like sky;
The flaxen curls and tender smile,
Light movements, lovely voice and waist,
All these adornments Olga has.
But any novel take and read,
And I am sure you will find
A heroine who will remind
Olga’s sweet image; it’s, indeed
Makes me annoyed, and not to pester
I’m switching to the elder sister.

XXIV

Tatiana was her sister’s name...
For tender verses it’s uncommon,
But I shall bring to it new fame
And sanctify by tender novel.
It’s sonorous and nice, no doubt,
When hearing it I think about
The mysteries of olden years
And maidens’ room; yet, I confess,
The native morals are corrupted
Affecting Russian names, as well
(And rhymes, so far as I can tell);
From education we’ve adopted,
Just airs and graces, nothing else,
The real learning they replace.

XXV

Thus, elder sister’s name Tatiana.
The same amaze she could not rise
As did the pretty charming minor,
Could not by same attraction prize.
She’s given to reflection, shy,
Like fallow deer when followed by,
And in the parents’ native home
Looked like not being of their own.
To show caress she hardly could
Neither to mother, nor to father,
Being a kid in children’s crowd
To jump and play she scarcely would.
And used in solitude to stay,
At window sitting all the day.

XXVI

Pensiveness was her best girlfriend
From very days of lullaby,
By dreams she used to decorate
The country’s idleness calm fly.
The mollycoddled fingers even
Didn’t ever touch a sewing needle,
She never knew how to make lace,
To pattern cloth with silky trace.
A thirst for ruling over omen...
With an obedient doll the girl
In jest prepares to play her role
In the high life, how to be formal,
And after mother repeats
The lessons of the public treats.

XXVII

But even in the adolescence
Tatiana didn’t take dolls on hands
And never used to give them lessons
Or tell the news or fashion trends.
And in the childish pranks and plays
She wasn’t involved, but loved the tales,
Which made excited and were fearful,
When being told at night in winter.
And when the nanny used to gather
The Olga’s little friends to play,
The race-and-catch or other game
On a capacious sunny meadow,
She didn’t enjoy the loud noise,
The ringing laugh and careless joys.

XXVIII

She loved to greet the coming dawning,
Forestall on balcony the day,
When in the pale sky night stars glowing
Diminishes and goes away,
Lightens the border of the Earth,
And wind, the morning sunrise worth,
Like herald blows - the day comes in.
In winter, when the days are thin,
A shade of night is calmly slipping,
And in the silent idle quiet
Under a faded dim moonlight
The lazy East for long is sleeping,
She woke up at a usual time
In the twilight of candles’ shine.

XXIX

She liked the novels since her young,
They opened universe to her,
And she preferred illusions’ tongue
Of Richardson and J. Russo.
Her dad was always nice and straight,
In the past century delayed;
Beware of books he had no ground
And never reading them had found
That they were just a hollow toy.
He absolutely did not mind,
What was that secret volume kind,
Which his shy daughter did enjoy.
So far as for his pleasant wife,
She was with Richardson in love.

XXX

Yes, she was fond of Richardson
Not thanks to his great novels reading
And, thus, preferring Grandison
To Lovelace hiding secret feeling.
Her Moscow cousin, young princess
Alina, who had read it, yes,
Told her of that, and just because
Her future spouse at that time was
Her suitor, whom she didn’t adore,
And she was sighing for a guy,
Who was more clever and less shy,
Whom she preferred and adored more.
This Grandison was brave and smart,
A gambler and a sergeant guard.

XXXI

Like him she used to be attired
In modern fashion, looking fine;
Though, wedding was against desire,
It was by parents sanctified.
To dissipate his spouse’s mourn
The clever husband very soon
Left to the country, where she found
Herself in Lord knows what surround.
She rent her hair and wept, at first,
But then, by household distracted,
And being by the life affected
She with her husband didn’t divorce.
We all get habit from above,
And it replaces good and love.

XXXII

The habit pacified her sorrow,
Which by no means could be repulsed,
She’d learned a hold to get it over
That resurrected her at last...
So switching business time and leisure
She had unveiled a secret measure
How to hold over like a reign
Her husband, thus to put away
Her mourn. She started to keep records,
Inspected field works on weekdays,
Enjoyed the baths on Saturdays,
Used to brine mushrooms and shave recruits,
She beat her maids for the omissions
And never asked for spouse permissions.

XXXIII

It happened that instead of ink
She by her blood the albums signed,
She named Praskov’ya Paulin,
And spoke singsong and deeply sighed;
She wore the corsets fitted tight
And Russian N in French did write;
When saying words, she nasalized;
But soon all that was finalized;
The corset, Album and Alina,
A copybook with touching rhymes
She had forsaken in past times,
Backed to Akul’ka from Selina
And finally decided that
It’s time to change the robe and hat.

XXXIV

The husband loved the sweetheart deeply,
Didn’t pay attention to her deals,
And trusting to the wife completely
In an old robe appeared to meals.
His life in calm and peace was streaming...
Sometimes, before the coming evening
Informal family of guests
In manor-house congregates
To mourn, to laugh, to title tattle
About passed and current life,
And when in parlor clock chimes five,
To order Olga tea, and later
A supper follows, say good night,
The guest are leaving satisfied.

XXXV

And they retained in calm and peace
The customs of the ancient time,
And during Russian Shrovetide feast
The oily pancakes used to fry.
Twice yearly fast they used to keep,
The round swings they liked to swing,
Loved to hear singing during lunch
And Whitsun round dances much,
And yawning listened to a prayer;
Compassioned, on a bunch of herb
Three tears by each they used to drop,
And kvass like air was necessary,
And at the table to the guests
The dish(e)s were served complied with ranks.

XXXVI

And that’s how they were growing old.
The husband first reached fatal limit,
Stepped over the Beyond threshold
And left the other world to visit.
He died before the time for lunch,
Was by the neighbors bemoaned much,
By children and his faithful wife,
Who shared with him the happy life.
He was a straight and kind lord,
And at a place his ash was laid
A mournful monument proclaimed...
Here Dmitry Larin - slave of God,
A brigadier and fair landlord,
Enjoys in peace the Great Beyond.

XXXVII

After return to hearth and home,
Vladimir Lensky came to visit
His neighbor’s sorrowful gravestone,
And heaved a sigh, when he did see it.
And for a long time he was sad.
“Poor Yorick - dolefully he said, -
He hold me on his hands sometimes,
I used to play with his war prize -
A medal he got from Suvorov!
Intended Olga he for me,
And used to say... when would it be?”
And stirred by a sincere sorrow
Vladimir started to inscribe
A madrigal at the graveside.

XXXVIII

And at the same place memorized
His parents by the filial tears
And weepy verses had inscribed
Being embraced by fatal fears.
The generations make a round,
Sprout out, mature and fade down
Controlled by Providence’s will;
Their issue follows same routine...
Thus, we, today in bloom and silly,
Grow up, enjoy, boil up and swing,
The ancestors to coffins bring.
But time for us will come, yes, really,
And the grandsons will oust us
And say politely “Bye, grandpas!”

XXXIX

So far, do revel your existence
And easy life, my novel’s friend!
I recognize its worthless essence
And am not scared to see the end;
My eyelids for illusions dropped,
But sometimes distant signs of hope
Disturb my heart... I realize
That it’ll be sad not recognized
To leave this world without traces.
I live and write not for a praise,
But, probably, want to amaze
The world and reveal real graces.
I hope the rhymes I’ve left behind
Will of the poet’s life remind.

XL

And they will touch somebody’s heart,
And being cared by lucky fate
The strophes and rhymes, which now I write,
Will not be lost in later date;
And I believe (myself I flatter!)
The issue will retain my letter,
Seeing my portrait, reading name
“He was the Poet!” they will say.
Thus, please, accept my real thanks
A fan of peaceful Aonides,
I greet the one who’ll recognize
My flying poetry’s attempts,
Whose thankful favorable hand
Will pet the laurels of old man!


Chapter III

I

"Where do you go? These crazy poets!”
- Goodbye, Onegin, time to leave.
“I don't hold you, but, to the point,
Where do you plan to spend the eve?”
- At Larins. - “That looks pretty nice.
And do you not at all despise
In such a boredom kill your time?”
- Not in the least. - “But it’s what I
From here can see and may suggest...
First, listen to me, am I right?
It is a kin of Russian rite,
Who loves to overwhelm the guests
With all these jams and nonstop talks
Of rain, of yard, of flax, of wax...”

II

- I do not see here any trouble.
“But boredom troubles me, my friend!”
- I hate your high society’s manner
And love the country’s modest trend,
When I can... - “Here, again eclogue!
Enough, my friend, for sake of God.
All right, you’re leaving, what a pity.
Though, listen, Lensky, you can treat it,
Can you let me see your Phyllida,
Who inspirers your poetic tone,
The tears, the verses and so on?
Present me to her”. - Are you kidding?
“Not, yet. And when?” - Let’s do it now.
They will be glad to meet us. - “Wow!

III

Let’s go.” - The friends jumped on the horses,
And when appeared were met by hosts
With all these tiresome resources,
As was established by the olds.
They welcomed guests and tried to feed
With all these jams and treats, indeed,
A waxen jug was placed on table -
Cowberry water for the neighbor,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

IV


They’re riding back the shortest way
And speed full tilt to make it quick,
Let’s overhear what do they say
To be aware of what they think.
- Well, well, Onegin, you are yawning. -
- “A habit, Lensky”. - You are boring
More than you used to do before. -
“No, it’s the same. It’s darkened, though.”
He shook the rein - “Gee up, Andryushka!
How dull and boring is the way!
And as for Larina, I’d say,
She’s simple but a nice babushka.
Cowberry water troubles me,
It disturbs stomach. Oh, my dear...

V

Can you tell me, who’s there Tatiana?”
- She is the one who’s looking sad,
Who was same silent as Svetlana,
Came in and at the window sat. -
“Do you adore the junior, really?
- And what? - “Not she would stir my feeling,
When I was a poetic guy.
There is no life in Olga’s style.
She’s like Madonna by Van-Dyke,
Who’s always perfect, utters bliss,
Like this fool moon in calm and peace
Illumes this also foolish sky”.
Vladimir answered with a frown
And all the way was mute and stern.

VI

Meanwhile, Onegin’s evening mission
To widow Larina’s estate
Had left a serious impression
And all the neighbors entertained.
The guesses shifted and they found
Not sinless but a playful ground
To show good judgment and to say
That he’s Tatiana’s fiance.
Some of them even clarified
That marriage settlement was made,
But then delayed because they failed
The modern wedding rings to find.
And that Vladimir plans to marry
All of them knew for long already.

VII

Tatiana heard with some vexation
This tittle-tattle nonsense, though,
She felt unreasoned hesitation,
The dim emotions stirred her soul.
And something sparkled in her heart;
The time had come, she fell in love.
Thus, grain in spring when falls on soil,
Sprouts out in a sunlight boil.
For long her flamed imagination
Stirred by a bliss and by a grief
Craved for a fatal heart relief;
For long a secret expectation
Did stir the youthful breast by flame,
She was awaiting... and he came.

VIII

Yes, he has come ... It’s cleared the sight;
And she pronounced... that is him!
And now the day and sleepless night
And burning solitary dream
All full of him; nonstop and endless
A magic force arose remembrance,
All speaks of him. She is annoyed
By pleasant words the people told
And glances of the maids around.
In gloomy thoughts her mind rests,
She does not listen to the guests
And curses all that her surrounds,
By neighbors visits she’s not pleased,
And execrates long stay of these.

IX

And what a serious attention
Attracts a novel, which she reads,
And what a lively inspiration
This fake delusion brings and heats!
She animated in her dreams
The heroes and the heroines...
A beau of Julia Volmar,
Malek-Adel and de Linar,
And Werther by the passions chained,
And super peerless Grandison,
Who causes nothing but a yawn, -
All of them in the dreamer’s brain
In single image were combined
And Eugene only did remind.

X

She dreams she is a heroine
By the creators, whom believes, -
Clarissa, Julia, Dauphin,
And strolling in the forests’ peace
Tatiana reads the books and finds
The things, which stir her inflamed mind,
The secret passions of her dreams,
The fruits of cordial extremes.
She sighs and to herself assigning
The others’ sorrow and delight
She in oblivion tells by heart
A note to one whom is admiring.
Whoever was my hero, yet,
He was not Grandison, I bet.

XI

An ardent thrilling novel author
His style to pompous fashion tunes
And a superior hero offers
To conquer us and to amuse,
Depicts a hero, whom he loves
(Who badly treated was not once),
A sensitive and tender fellow
With handsome face and who is clever,
Who’s ready to be killed for friend
Being inflamed by purest passion.
He always leaves the best impression,
And in last chapter’s very end
The vice is punished, after that
The virtue gets the triumph wreath.

XII

But nowadays the minds are foggy,
Morality inspires a yawn,
The vice is welcomed, in the stories
The virtue is not gloried more.
The British Muse’s fairytales
Disturb the maidens’ sleeps and plays,
And now the objects for desire
Are either despondent Vampire
Or Melmoth by the phantoms tortured,
Eternal Jew or brave Corsair
Or so mysterious Sbogar.
Lord Byron thanks to lucky fortune
Drowned us in fade romanticism
And always hopeless egoism.

XIII

Oh, my dear friends, is all in vain?
And, maybe, sometimes willed by heaven,
Poetic dreams will leave my brain,
I’ll be engaged by other demon,
And despite radiant Phoebus threat
I’ll to submissive prose descend;
In old traditions routine novel
Will occupy me being old man.
Not secret evil fatal tortures
I shall depict in passion’s storm,
I shall rehearse you being stern
The tales of Russian nobles’ fortunes,
The charming dreams of adoration,
The mores and manners of the ancient.

XIV

I shall retell the casual speeches
Of dad and uncle, old and frail,
The children’s hold in secret meetings
At the old lime trees and a well,
The dismal jealousy wild torments,
Departs, reconciliation moments;
I’ll force them quarrel, after that
Shall put on them a wedding wreath...
I’ll recall speech of tender passion,
The words of melancholic love,
Which in the days I told above
At beauty’s legs in the affection
Used to occur in my flamed mind
And which today I’ve left behind.

XV

Tatiana, charming girl Tatiana!
With you I drop my tears today,
To awful hands of fancy tyrant
You’ve given up your life and fame.
You’ll perish, darling, but before
For vague and obscure bliss you call
And dazzled by an expectation
You learn the pangs of adoration,
You drink desire’s magic venom,
You’re followed by an unreal dream
And do imagine one same thing -
For happy dates a lovely venue;
And everywhere in front of you
There is your tempter’s fatal view.

XVI

Anguish of love drives Tanya out,
She escapes to the park to mourn,
Then, sudd(e)nly stops, can’t look around,
Is paralyzed by lazy mood.
Her breast high raised, the heart beats fast,
The breath has stopped to leave the chest,
The cheeks start instantly to blaze,
Noise in the ears, the burning gaze ...
The night falls down, and the moon
Patrols the remote heavens’ dome;
A nightingale starts singing song
In the dark shades of leafy room.
Tatiana in the dark doesn’t sleep,
And in hush tone to nanny speaks...

XVII

“I can’t sleep... stifling... nanny, darling!
Open the window, sit with me”.
- What’s with you, Tanya? - “I am boring,
Let’s talk of old times and of thee”.
- What can I tell you, Tanya? Sometimes
I used to know the tales of old times,
Both, very true and purely fibs,
About maidens, evil beasts;
But now all drawn in darkness, Tanya...
What I did know, forgotten, yes.
It’s not the best age I do guess.
I am worn out... - "Tell me, nanny
About olden times of yours...
You were in love, sometimes, of course.”

XVIII

- Ah, Tanya! Never in these times
We heard of love or knew, what’s it,
My mother-in-law otherwise
Would yell at me and then get rid. -
“But tell me, nanny, how’s your wedding?”
- I think it was what God was telling.
I was thirteen years old, you see,
And Vanya younger was than me.
Matchmaker at my home appeared
Not once to deal the marriage, and
My father blessed me in the end.
I shed the tears, was scared and feared,
But they with cry undid by braid,
And singing songs to church conveyed.

XIX

And thus, I switched to a strange being ...
But you’re not listening to me... -
“Ah, nanny, nanny, I am grieving,
I’m giddy, nanny, you can see...
I’m close to weeping, ululating!..”
- My poor child, are you fainting?
Oh, God, have mercy upon us!
If you need something, please, just ask ...
The holly water will help, maybe,
You are in fever... - “Not at all,
I am in love, yes, nanny” - Oh,
I’ll pray to God, and He will save you! -
The nanny said a prayer and
Crossed Tanya with a senile hand.

XX

“I am in love”, - she whispered faintly
To the babushka in despair.
- My bosom fellow, are you healthy? -
“I am in love, please, go away”.
And at that time the moon was shining
By languor light illumining
The inconspicuous charming fair,
Her falling down flowing hair,
And drops of tears, and at the bed
In front of the affected girl
A granny in a quilted coat,
A kerchief on her gray-haired head.
And all around was in dream,
Inspiring moon illumed the scene.

XXI

Tatiana’s soul flew far away,
And looking at the moon she told...
“Leave me alone, please, go away...”
A daring thought at once occurred.
“Give me the pen and paper, nanny,
And move the desk; I will be ready
To go to bed quite soon”. And thus,
She is alone with moon and stars.
Leaned on the desk she something scribbles.
Only Eugene is in her thought,
That’s what the heart of virgin sought.
The hasty letter the love figures.
Now, it is ready, can we see,
Who is Tatiana’s addressee?

XXII

I knew the beauties beyond reaching,
Like winter cold and sovereign,
Implacable, to love resisting,
Incomprehensible for brain;
I wondered at their haughty pride,
Their inborn virtue unconfined,
And I confess escaped from these,
Above their perfect eyebrows is
A dreadful signet of inferno...
Forget your hope forever, guy!
Arousing love for them is crime,
To frighten men for them is clever.
Perhaps sometimes on Neva’s banks
You also saw that breed of cranks.

XXIII

I saw the other whimsy ladies,
Ambitiously unconfined,
Insensitive to sighs and praises
Of the admirers on behind.
And what did me at all that wonder?
By stern behavior they made ground
To frighten timid love at first,
But then to make it even worse.
At least regret they demonstrated,
At least the sounds of their talks
Sometimes aroused the hopeful thoughts,
And being disorientated
Again young lover burned by flame
Tried to chase shade of love in vain.

XXIV

Why is Tatiana guiltier then?
May be because her simple soul
Doesn’t know what is deceit and can
Believe in what her heart has told?
Or since she loves with no dissembling
Completely to her love surrendering,
Since she is trustful and from Heaven
Got a sincere artless talent,
And the inflamed imagination,
The clever mind and soul’s thrill,
An independent lively will,
A heart that beats in tender passion?
And would not you forgive to her
The lightness of the passions whirl?

XXV

Coquette makes judgment in cold mind,
Tatiana manifests in earnest
Her love, abandons like a child,
Whose feels are absolutely honest.
She does not say... I’d better wait,
The price of love by that upgrade.
Will organize a trap and bring
To the seductive nets, then, sting
By vanity, then, hope exciting
By puzzlement the heart disturb
And that by jealousy promote;
Since, when surfeited with delighting,
He would be glad to cast off chain,
Like does a convict in a jail.

XXVI


But here I see another trouble...
To save the honor of my land
I’ll be compelled, and that’s no doubt,
Tatiana’s letter to translate.
To know well Russian she'd no need
And native magazines didn’t read.
About private things to tell
In native language could not well.
And thus, in French she used to write.
What can I do! I repeat...
Till now the female’s love doesn’t need
To be expressed in Russian, right
Till now, it’s not the language, which
Is widely used in letters’ speech.

XXVII

I know, they try to force the ladies
To read in Russian. Ah, my friends!
No one of these I can imagine
With “Russian Journal” in their hands!
I plead to poets... were not really
The pretty subjects, to whom sinning
You wrote in secrecy your rhymes,
Of whom a poet sighs and pines,
To whom your heart you dedicated,
Were poor in Russian language, yet,
Had understood it pretty bad
And so amusingly translated,
And has not they converted now
The stranger tongue into home one?

XXVIII

God save me at a public meeting
Or when departing at the steps
To face an academic being
In yellow shawl or ladies’ hat!
Like with no smile the pretty lips,
I do not like the Russian speech
With no grammatical mistakes.
But maybe sometimes prayers thanks
The beauties’ novel generation
Will native grammar start to learn,
Will understand the Russian term,
And launch the rhymes to operation.
But me... why should it bother me?
I’ll be old-fashioned, yes, I’ll be.

XXIX

Irregular and careless babble,
Inexact accent of the talks
As before stir my heart to tremble,
Remind me my roots and folks.
And to repent I can’t afford
Of Gallicisms I shall be fond
As of the sins of youthful times
And Bogdanovich’s perfect rhymes.
But that’s enough. It’s time for me
To represent my beauty’s letter.
I gave my word. But what’s the matter,
I’m close to stop it, let me see.
I know, that tender Parny’s pen
Does not comply with modern trend.

XXX

The friend of feasts and melancholy,
If you could still remain with me,
I’d ask you for a favor, for me
Interpret what is worth of thee,
And do translate the virgin’s passions
Into the poetry’s expressions.
I call to you, please come and do,
I’ll transfer all my rights to you.
I’ll be so thankful for assistance...
But in the midst of dismal rocks
You have forgotten praise for songs,
You are alone and with persistence
Do stroll under the Finish sky
And do not hear my wistful cry.

XXXI

Tatiana’s letter I look over,
It makes a sacred thing to me,
I read it with a mystic sorrow,
And cannot, cannot stop to read.
Who prompted her this tender passion
And words amicable expression?
Who prompted touching voice to her,
The reckless heart inspired for
This detrimental captive story?
I cannot catch it well, but still
Present to you (that makes me thrill)
A lively picture’s pallid copy,
Performing by the shy school girls
The Weber’s Freischutz at their homes:

Tatiana’s letter to Onegin

I write to you, - what can be further?
What can I tell to you besides?
You may disdain me and moreover
By your neglection penalize.
But maybe you can still discover
A drop of pity in your soul,
You shall not leave my heart alone.
At first I wanted to keep silent;
Believe me, you would never know
My shame, whenever my poor soul
Might hope and just a chance could find
Enjoy your visiting to us,
Not often, maybe weekly, thus,
To see you and to hear your speeches,
To tell few words to you and then
To dream of seeing you again,
To get a chance to watch your features.
You don’t like visits, people say,
In country wilderness you’re boring,
But we… by nothing being famed,
Your visits really enjoying.

Why did you come to visit us?
In backwoods of forgotten hamlet,
I should not know of you and thus,
I should not know the bitter torment.
An inexperienced soul’s excitement
Restrains with lapse of time, at last,
A cordial friend I’d maybe find,
Would be a mother nice and kind,
Would be a husband’s faithful spouse.

Another!.. No, it is quite fatal,
I won’t give up my heart’s adores!
It’s by the heaven’s council settled…
It is a divine will: I’m yours;
Since all my life was just a pledge
Of right appointment with thee;
I know that God, who’s always sage,
Sends you take custody of me…
You came to me in the night visions,
Invisible, you were my dear,
Your lovely gaze impelled my thrill,
Your voice I heard in my illusions
For long … No, that was not a dream!
You just came in, and in a moment
I was astonished, I was burning,
My lips did whisper: it is him!
And wasn’t it you, whom I heard speaking,
In silence you conversed with me,
And wasn’t it you, of whom was thinking
Dispensing alms or when was seeking
To quench by pray grieve burning me?
And in this very-very instant
Was it not you, to whom I listened:
In limpid darkness you flicked up,
As consolation to me whispered
Inspiring words so nice and blissful
And nestled at my head in dark?
Who are you, maybe, guardian angel,
Or cunning tempter sent by devil:
Please, settle my heart hesitation.
But, maybe, all that is worth free
Or just the virgin soul’s frustration!
Another fate is waiting me…
I can’t betray my heart and thus
In front of you I’m shedding tears,
Please, be my guard, whom I do trust,
I beg, do terminate my fears.
Can you imagine, I’m alone,
Nobody here can learn my mind,
My brain gives up escape to find
In the dead silence being drawn.
I'm waiting you: so, do, at once,
Reanimate the heart reliance
Or terminate the gloomy silence
By worthy of reproaching glance!

That’s it! I’m scared to read again…
My heart by shame and fear is dying…
Your honor for me is a bail,
I’m fearlessly on it relying…

XXXII

Tatiana ohhs, and ahhs and sighs,
The letter flickers in her hand,
On inflamed tongue pink sticker dries,
Rereading letter can not end.
Her head has bent to naked shoulder,
A chemise on the neck has folded
Uncovering the charming bend…
Meanwhile, the night comes to its end.
The moon shy dies away, the valley
Clears out through a morning steam.
A creek is silvered by a beam,
A shepherd’s horn far away playing.
The country woke up long ago,
Tatiana doesn’t care, not at all.

XXXIII

She does not notice coming morning,
With droopy head sits at the lamp;
To sign the letter not affording
She dare not seal it with carved stamp.
To press carved signet can’t afford.
The nanny opens bedroom door
And warely steps on squeaky floor;
A cup of tea is on the tray.
“Good morning, darling, time to wake!
But you are already prepared!
Oh, what an early bird, my dear!
Last evening you awoke my fear!
Have you forgotten all your care?
No more night sorrow I can trace
On your like poppy burning face”.

XXXIV

- Ah, nanny, can you give a favor. -
“With pleasure, sweet heart, just direct”.
- Believe me... truly... my behavior...
But look... ah..! Please, do not neglect. -
“My darling, honestly to God!”
- Then send your grandson with this note
To O... Excuse, to this, to whom...
The neighbor, and please do it soon.
He should not say a word, oh, never!
He should not mention there my name! -
“To whom shall I the note convey?
I am so old and no more clever.
There’s plenty neighbors, yes, it is;
I can’t just count all of these”.

XXXV

- How poorly you are witting nanny!
“My cordial friend, but I am old ...
Yes, Tanya, old, and can’t wit sanely,
But sometimes I was keen and bold,
It happened that the nobles willing...”
"Ah, nanny, nanny! Am I really
Concerned with your slow witting mind?
This letter should Onegin find. -
“Oh, yes, that’s perfect, that’s good deal,
Please, don’t be angry with me Tanya,
Forgive my obscured mind kindly...
You’re growing pale again, my dear!”
- No, nanny, nothing, I am not,
Please, send your grandson with this note. -

XXXVI

A day flew by - no reply letter,
The next has come - no reply yet.
She’s pale and worries, what’s the matter,
Since morning dressed awaits for that.
Olga’s admirer came to them,
The hostess asked a question, then...
“Your friend doesn’t visit us for long,
Is he all right, or something wrong?”
Tatiana blushed, began to tremble.
- He promised to be here today,
But maybe’s delayed by the mail. -
Vladimir answered to the granny.
Tatiana felt unreasoned shame
Like hearing someone’s spiteful blame.

XXXVII

It’s getting dark; on table shining
The evening samovar made hiss.
It warmed up tea in pot from China
A light steam swirling under this.
The fragrant tea by dark jet streaming
Poured by the Olga’s hand was filling
Placed on the table china cups;
A boy served creamer; there’s no fuss;
Tatiana at the window standing
Was breathing on a chilly pane
And, pensively, the cherished name
By charming finger was amending...
The sacred monogram E. O.
Erasing inscribed by a blow.

XXXVIII

Meanwhile, her soul was hit by feeling,
The languid glance was full of tears.
But thud of horses' hoofs appearing
Made blood to still, provoked her fears.
“It is Eugene!” And light like shadow,
Tatiana hopped to a back stairway,
From porch to yard she rushed in scare,
She flied, to turn back did not dare.
She ran around in a moment
The grassland, bridges and parterre,
The alley to the lake and there
The lilac’s bushes broke and all that
She flashed across and at the lake
On a park bench obtained escape.

XXXIX

She dropped ... “He’s here, Onegin!
Oh, God, save me, what could he think!”
Her heart by bitter torment flaming
Keeps hope but feels like at a brink;
She shivers with the cheeks aglow,
Strains all her hearing just to know
He’s found her or not, but, yet,
The maids were singing at the bed...
They gathered berries being ordered
To sing in chorus to prevent
Eating host’s berries doing that
And were engaged in song performing.
(That was the locals’ smart invention
For landlords’ property protection!)

We shall decoy a young man
Watching him from far away,
We’ll run off, my sweetheart girls,
And with cherries pelt him, then,
With cherries and raspberries
And redcurrants besides these.
You shouldn’t come to listen to
The songs, which are intimate,
Do not come to gaze at us,
How the virgins entertain.

XL

They sing, but just with no attention
Tatiana listens to their voice,
She is awaiting with impatience,
When will relax heart stirring whirls,
When cheeks aglow will disappear.
But in her breast she feels same stir,
The cheeks just brighter glow and glow,
And burn and burn just more and more...
That’s how a butterfly is shining
Beating in seizures by the wing,
When naughty boy detains poor thing,
That’s how a hare in field is trying
To get escape when at a distance
A hunter threats to its existence.

XLI

But finally a deep sigh heaving,
She dared to leave the hiding site,
Began to walk restraining feeling,
Turned to the alley to the right...
In front of her by glances blazing
Onegin stands like specter shading.
And being shocked like burned by flame
Tatiana at her place remained.
What happened then upon that meeting
I won’t tell you today, my friend,
Though, do not want my tale to end.
I just do need after long speaking
To take a brake and have a rest...
Sometimes will finish it, I guess.


Chapter IV

I

The less you show your love to woman,
The more attractive, thanks to that
Can catch her fancy and then ruin
In well-arranged seductive net.
Coldblooded lechery sometimes
Was celebrated as love science.
They used to relish just the lust
And in the love they did not trust.
But this so serious distraction
Is worth of overmature apes,
Remains in vaunted grandpas’ age...
Today, Lovelace has lost attraction,
The stately wigs' and red heels' fame
Has vanished with the passing day.

VIII

Who wouldn’t be bored to simulate,
Diversely repeat same things,
And looking serious persuade
Of what no one distrusts long since,
To listen to the same objections,
Destroy the prejudice perceptions,
Which never had and never has
A naive girl in thirteen years!
Who wouldn’t be worn by threats and lies,
By seeming fears, by oaths and prayers,
By billet-doux on seven pages,
By gossip, tears, rings, weepy rhymes,
By aunts’ and mothers’ watch and care
And husbands’ friendship so unfair!

IX

That’s what exactly thought Onegin.
In adolescence’s first days
He was seduced by unchecked craving,
Fell victim of the passions plays.
By the life habit pretty spoilt,
With one thing being just annoyed,
With other charmed but not for long,
By the desires slowly gnawed,
Gnawed by a flip success obtaining,
Perceiving in the noise and quiet
Chronic complain of soul insight,
The yawning by the laugh restraining...
That’s how he had killed eight young years,
Which should be all his life’s the best.

X

He stopped to fall in love with beauties,
But dangled after them somehow;
When was declined - no painful duties,
When was deceived - take rest so far.
He searched for them without rapture,
And left just never being captured
Not by affection, nor by spite,
Like listless visitor by night
Is used to go somewhere for gambling.
He starts to play, game over and
He leaves the partners in the end,
At home he sleeps without trembling;
When waking up he does not know,
Where in the evening he will go.

XI

But after Tanya’s note receiving,
Onegin was vividly stirred,
The tongue by which the girl was dreaming
A swarm of thoughts in him conceived.
And he recalled sweetheart Tatiana’s
Dismal appearance and pail colors;
His lonely soul immersed in dream
Into a sweet and sinless stream.
Maybe, the ancient flame of passion
Captured his mind, anyway,
He was not ready to betray
The naive souls’ sincere confession.
Now let us transfer to the place,
Where he met Tanya face to face.

XII

Two minutes they were staying silent,
Onegin, then, came close to her
And said... "You wrote me, don’t deny it,
I’ve read what you have pleaded for...
The trustful naive girl’s confession,
Effusion of your soul’s affection;
Yes, your sincerity is cute,
It stirred my heart for so long mute,
Provoked the silenced feels resembling;
But I don’t want to praise you, yet,
And shall repay to you for that,
Confess like you with no dissembling,
Display my fortune to your view...
Thus, make a judgment and review.

XIII

“Should I want to confine my being
By a home circle like all do,
And should it be my fortune’s willing
To maintain spouse and father’s due,
Should I by family nice picture
Just for a moment can be captured,
Then nobody, but you, I swear,
I’d love to be my lady fair.
I say without lyric tinsel...
Just only you were and could be
The only one, whom I would see
As girlfriend of my sad existence,
You’d be a pledge of good to me,
I would be happy... as could be!

XIV

“But I was born not for a pleasure;
It’s what my soul does not accept;
In vain are all your priceless treasures,
I am not worth of that, I bet.
Believe me (conscience is my bail)
The marriage for us will make jail.
However much I’d love you now,
Will get used to and stop to love;
You’ll start to weep, but tears of yours
Will not at all disturb my soul,
But stir up rage and make it boil.
Thus, you can judge, what bunch of rose
Will bring to us these Hymen’s plays,
And probably for many days.

XV

“I can’t imagine worse than find
A family, where a poor wife
Regrets for an unworthy husband
Staying alone the day and night;
Where a dull husband knows her value,
Yet, saying nothing but God damn you,
Is always frowning, taciturn,
Poisoned by jealousy and stern!
Am I the one you did search for,
You, who are flaming, smart and clear,
With whom you dared to be sincere,
To whom you wrote with burning soul?
And are you ready to accept
This so much awful cruel fate?

XVI

“The dreams and years have passed, another
I can’t get and my soul update...
I love you by a love of brother
And maybe tenderly than that.
Please listen to me with no temper...
I’m not an evil virgins tempter,
One dream will change the other ones,
Like sapling changes leaves not once,
According to the seasons, yearly.
That’s by the heaven predestined.
You’ll fell in love again. Same time...
You should control yourself, be wary.
Don’t do again same thing you did,
The innocence can trouble bring”.

XVII

That’s how Onegin moralized.
Tatiana listened to his preach;
She didn’t object, tears in the eyes,
And dare not interrupt his speech.
He stretched his arm, and she with sorrow
Like in the absent mind followed
His gesture, and leaned on his hand
Declining languid head at that;
And they went home circling the garden;
Appeared together, and no one
Did try to blame them for the done...
The country’s morals become rather
Broad-minded, there’s no reproach,
Pomp Moscow shows the same approach.

XVIII

You should agree with me, my reader,
Onegin was quite fair and nice
With Tanya, who was too sincere.
Not for the first time he surprised
Me by his noble soul’s perfection,
Though ill-willed people's imperfection
Forgave him nothing, I can tell...
The enemies and friends, as well
(And these are probably same matter)
Were cursing him this way and that.
You can't make everybody glad,
My God, please save us from the latter,
The so called friends! And not in vain
I do remind you of them!

XIX

And what? Don’t worry. I calm down
These fruitless and so gloomy dreams;
In brackets only I mark out
There’re no such lie or dirty tricks
Born at a garret by a liar
And by the public mobs inspired,
There’re no such nonsense, such a froth,
Or epigram the garbage worth,
Which among men of upright fashion
Your best friend with a smile not once
Did not reiterate by chance
Without malice or intention;
But he will beat for you his breast...
He loves you like your kinfolk, yes!

XX

Well, well! My kind noble reader,
Are all your kinfolk in good health?
I beg your pardon, are you ready,
I'll now explain it by myself,
What does the kinfolk in fact mean.
I give my definition here...
We must respect them and be fair,
Caress and take of them good care,
And must arrange the Christmas meetings,
Since that complies with people’s rites,
Or mail them postcards otherwise
With best regards and other greetings.
Then, all the rest time of the year
They won’t disturb you. Yes, take care!

XXI

However, love of tender pretties
Is safer than of friends and kin...
No one requires to relinquish
The rights, when sudden storms begin.
That’s true, of course. But whirl of fashion,
Besides, the nature’s self-expression,
The high society’s views and mind...
And pretty sex like fluff is flying.
Opinion of a husband, then,
By a good willed and sinless wife
Should always be respected, right?
Thus, your reliable girl friend
In flash can be enticed away...
Yes, Satan likes with love to play!

XXII

Whom can you trust? Where love can find?
Who’ll never cheat you or betray?
Who’s always positive and kind,
And only good to you will say?
Who does not sow a bitter slander,
Who’s with you always nice and tender?
To whom your vice is not a trouble?
Who won’t annoy, like does the other?
Are you a seeker for a shadow?
Don’t spend your energy in vain,
But love yourself and don’t complain,
Enjoy yourself my dear fellow!
That is a subject best of all!
You want say thank you? - Not at all!

XXIII

And what resulted from the meeting?
Alas! It’s easy to divine!
The reckless adoration feeling
Could not relax or pacify.
She can’t learn an escape for soul.
No, faithful to the passion’s vow,
Tatiana burns in feeling’s flame,
She does not sleep, her face turns pale.
Her blossom, health and vivid feeling,
Her smile and modest virgin grace
All disappears like empty phrase,
And Tanya’s charming youth is chilling...
Thus, stormy shade eclipses light
Of starting day, which looked so bright.

XXIV

Alas, Tatiana now is fading,
She’s pale, extinct and always quiet!
Nothing can make her entertaining,
And nothing can her soul excite.
The neighbors shaking pompous heads
Discuss the matter, heave the breaths,
Give the advice... it’s time for marriage!...
But that’s enough to relish ravage.
To entertain imagination
By picture of a happy love
I shall start now, though all above
(Despite well-reasoned deprecation)
I place Tatiana’s vivid feels.
I do love her, excuse me please!

XXV

Young Vladimir is fascinated
By Olga’s merits more and more
His ardent heart is captivated
By her good looks and kind soul.
He’s always with her. In her room
They sit in front like bride and groom,
And in the garden like close friends
Stroll every morning holding hands.
And what? By the love saturated
And being disarrayed and shy
He only rarely dares to try
By Olga’s nice smile animated
Her ringlet bashfully to twist
Or the long dress’s trim to kiss.

XXVI

It happens, he recites to Olya
A sentimental moral tale,
Where author knows the nature more than
Chateaubriand used to explain.
When doing that, two or three pages,
(Frivolous blather, idle fables
Unsafe for hearts of virgin girls)
He skips and flushing red, then, turns.
And hiding far away from people
They sit and look at a chessboard
And feel quite lonely in their world,
Where nothing can disturb or hit them;
And Lensky wandering in drowse
By pawn takes rook, but not of hers.

XXVII

When coming home, at home as well
He dreams of Olga all the time.
His albums’ sheets were very well
Embellished with the paints and rhymes...
He draws an ancient Venus tomb,
The country view and sad gravestone,
A little pigeon on a lyre
Depicts by pen and colors fine;
Then on the sheets with recollections,
Below the others’ words and signs,
He leaves his sentimental rhymes,
A speechless monument to passions,
The instant ballad’s long-term trace
That is the same for many years.

XXVIII

You did see and not once, no doubt,
An album of exalted girl
That was inscribed from top around
By girlfriends’ oeuvres overall,
Right here, orthography defying,
They were their feelings signifying...
As a keepsake they used to rhyme,
Extend, then brief and then combine.
There, on the first sheet, you are meeting...
Qu' ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;
And signet t. a v. Annette;
And on the last one you are reading...
“Who loves you more than I do thee
Should attempt writing after me”.

XXIX

Indeed, on these sheets you will find
The burning torch, two hearts and bloom,
The adjuration will remind...
I’m loving you to edge of doom;
Some poetaster from armed forces
Had scribbled here the obscene verses.
It is an album, where, my friends,
I’d love to write with no restraints.
Yes, in my soul there is no doubt
That all the rubbish I write now
Will still deserve somebody’s bow,
They won’t with malice grin spell out
And with a swagger analyze
How smart I was when telling lies.

XXX

But you, so odd and scattered volumes
From the infernal library,
And you, superbly looking albums,
The throe of poetastery,
The scripts by Tolstoy animated,
By his brush nimbly decorated
Or marked by Baratynsky’s pen,
I wish you’d burned by thunder bang!
And when a splendid noble lady
Her nice in-quarto hands to me,
I'm shuddering in rage, you see ;
It irritates and makes me angry;
An epigram stirs in my soul,
But they, ...for madrigals they call!

XXXI

But in the album of young Olga
Vladimir writes not madrigals;
He does not wit by remarks coldly,
His pen by adoration smiles;
All stuff that he is hearing, seeing
About Olga he is limning,
The elegies gush out of him
Full of live verity by stream.
That’s how Yazykov instigated
By noble impulses of soul
Presents the elegies’ rich row,
Just Lord knows whom he’s celebrated.
There, maybe sometimes he will read
The story of the life he lived.

XXXII

But hush! You hear? A critic strictly
Commands from elegy take off
The wrath of sound mind quickly,
At poetasters yells... “do stop
To weep, to cry and like a frog
Reiterate one and same croak,
Regret for past and for bygone;
Enough, please, sing another song!”
- Yes, you are right indeed requiring
To recollect pipe, mask and blade,
The mortal phantoms resurrect -
These are dead treasures you’re inspiring!
Am I correct, my dear milords?
“Not, yet! Please, do compose the odes,

XXXIII

Like used to be in the best time,
Like was established by the olds...”
- You just the solemn odes require!
Enough, my friend, enough, no odds!
Remember, what did say satirist!
Does foreign fashion cunning lyrist
Annoy us less than use to do that
A doleful native so-called poet? -
“But all in elegy is poor,
Its idle purpose makes no sense.
Purpose of ode makes high expense,
It's noble..." Here I could, for sure,
Argue with you, but won’t do that,
To clash two centuries I hate.

XXXIV

In stir of stormy reckless thoughts,
By liberty and glory pleased,
Vladimir would love to write odes,
But Olga was not fond of these.
Did ever any weepy poet
Use to declaim his solemn poem
To his beloved? I heard, they said,
There’s no best award he could get.
Blessed is a modest lover really,
When reading passions of his soul
Devoting his poetic song
To his fair lady, nice and pleasing!
He’s blessed... But, maybe, at that time
She feels indifferent to rhyme?

XXXV

My fruits of reveries effusion
And of the lyre harmonic plays
I read to nanny in seclusion,
She is a friend of my young days,
And also sometimes gnaw a neighbor,
Who comes to share my boring table,
By reading to him tragic book
Have caught his suit flap in the nook.
Or else, and here without jesting,
By rhythms and anguish being pined
I stroll and nobody can find
A lonely lake, where darks are nesting,
Where heeding my sonorous strophes
The flocks of darks from banks fly off.

XXXVI XXXVII

I shall request for your excuse...
His everyday routine and studies
I shall in detail introduce.
Onegin lived like real hermit,
He waked up early in the morning,
And after waking straight from bed
Walked to the river lightly clad.
By singer of Corsair inspired,
This Hellespont he swam across,
Then, coffee drank and in a drowse
To read a magazine desired,
And, then, he dressed...

XXXVIII XXXIX

The walks, deep sleep, relax and reading,
The forest’s shade and waters’ hiss,
Sometimes an unsuspected meeting
And a dark-eyed blonde’s charming kiss.
Riding a steed to bridle obedient,
A tasteful lunch, when it’s convenient,
A bottle of a nice white wine,
And calm, and solitary time.
That is Onegin’s sacred living.
And he, indifferent to passions,
Gave up to summer days impressions,
Enjoyed this careless languor being,
Forgot the city and his friends,
And boredom of the feast events.

XL

But in my north, the summer season
Just mimics south winter, yes...
Flashed on and off, though despite reason
It’s what we scarcely would confess.
The sky was breathing by the autumn
The sun was shining not so often,
And shorter had become the day,
The groves were getting dull and bare.
It makes you sad, calms down feelings.
The fog laid on the bottom lands,
And in the sky geese caravans
With cries flied south. Summer’s leaving.
A boring season at threshold;
November brought first snow and cold.

XLI

A dawn gets up in chilly shadow,
The noise of works in fields has died;
A wolf chased by his hungry fellow
At the main road appears at night.
A driving horse has scented trouble
And snorts; the rider being worried
Speeds at full tilt in a great fear;
At dawn, a shepherd at the hill
Doesn’t push the cows from shed for feeding,
And does not play in the midday
His pipe to call them from away;
A maid in hut a thread is spinning;
She’s singing, friend of winter nights -
A splinter crackles smokes and lights.

XLII

The biting frost the nature froze,
The spacious fields are shining silver...
(Here you expect a rhyme with rose;
Yes, take it please, my eager reader!)
The river shines in ice attiring
And looks more neat than parquet tiling.
The joyful nation of the boys
Is skating on the ice with noise;
A goose on reddish feet decided
To swim across the water world;
He steps on ice with care, and what?
He slides and falls; the first snow flying
Is twinkling, spinning by the whirls,
And by the stars falls on the shores.

XLIII

In backwoods, what to do this season?
To take a stroll? The country view
Does not produce attractive vision
By nakedness annoying you.
To ride horseback in severe steppes?
A horse can fall when making steps
On slippery and icy ground;
You’d better stay in safe surround.
In lonely indoors enjoy reading,
Here’s Pradt, and here is Walter Scott.
Don’t want to read? - Then, prices quote,
Get angry, drink, get pleased by eating.
And anyhow the day is over,
You’re looking for the same tomorrow.

XLIV

Like Childe Harold looks Onegin,
In pensive lazy mood remains...
He takes an ice bath after waking,
And in his nook spends all the days.
Alone, immersed in estimation,
Devoid of any animation,
Just after leaving morning drowse
He’s playing billiard with two balls.
And when the country night is coming,
He leaves pool room, puts cue aside,
Arranges table at fireside.
Onegin waits... here’s Lensky driving,
The troika roans have pulled the sledge.
It’s dinner time for country sage!

XLV

Widow Clicquot or famous Moet,
The divine wine is always blessed,
In frozen bottle for the poet
It’s on the table quickly placed.
It sparkles like a sacred spring
(And, thus, reminds me something).
The sprinkling bubbles and the foam
Imprison me. Not long ago
I used to spend my last one lepton
To get it. I retain, my friends,
How it’s majestic sprinkling jets
Making a lively cheering fountain
Gave rise to many silly things,
The disputes, verses, cheerful dreams!

XLVI

But gushing out hissing foam
Disturbs my stomach, that is why
To be more modest I prefer
And drink Bordeaux - a prudent wine.
I cannot handle Ai more,
It’s not the thing I’m searching for,
Ai is similar to lover -
Impatient, frivolous and wayward.
But you, Bordeaux, like a close friend,
Who, both, in trouble and in sorrow,
The other day, today, tomorrow
Did, do and always will extend
The welcome hand and share pastime.
Hurrah, Bordeaux, best friend of mine!

XLVII

The flame is dying, by the ashes
Are lightly covered golden coals,
And by the slightly noticed splashes
A steam is swirling making coils.
The chimney gives the final sighs,
The smoke from pipes in chimney dies,
A goblet makes a final hiss,
The dark is falling like a mist...
(I love the friendly idle speeches
And friendly goblet of the wine
At that night period of time,
Which people in the country features
As between wolf and dog). That’s fine.
About what they talk this time?

XLVIII

“How are the neighbors? How’s Tatiana?
How’s frisky Olga spending time?”
- Please, pour me half a glass more, brother...
Enough, my darling... They are fine
And healthy, send regards to you.
Ah, darling, Olga is so pure!
Look at her shoulders and her breast,
She is just blooming! Someday let’s
Go visit them; they will be pleased.
You know, my friend, how can it be...
You dropped in twice, and disappeared.
They don’t deserve to be displeased.
Oh, how could I forget, Goddamn!
Next week you should go visit them. -

XLIX

“And what?” - Tatiana’s name-day party,
On Saturday. My dear and mom
Want see you; yes, you are invited,
This time you shouldn’t neglect the call. -
 “A lot of people will be there,
Ragtag and bobtail, that’s nightmare...”
- Nobody will be there like that!
Only the family, I bet.
Let’s do it, please, give me a favor.
So, what? - “All right”. - You are so nice! -
And saying that he drained a glass
And did it to the health of neighbor.
Then, they began to talk again
Of love, of Olga, all the same!

L

And he was joyful being glad
That in two weeks he’ll earn the treasure -
A secret of the nuptial bed,
The wrath of love and of lust pleasure
His flaming soul will shortly find.
And what did never learn his mind,
It’s Hymen’s bonds and monotone,
The troubles, boredom and so on.
To tell the truth, I hate Hymen,
And domesticity don’t like,
The boring pictures only sight
As was described by Lafontaine...
But my poor Lensky... yes, he was
Conceived for all these dreams and drowse.

LI

He thought he’s loved, and in his mind
Remained quite happy. Blessed is that,
Who is by naive faith inspired,
Who the cold mind can distract,
In sweet oblivion is resting,
Like drunken wayfarer is nesting,
Or, gently, like a morning moth,
That sucks the flower’s sap off;
But pitiful is who foresees,
Who can’t be captured by the feelings,
Who all the movements, all the readings
Disdains, subjects to expertise,
Who by experience is chilled,
And by the common sense is willed!

Chapter V

I

It was a year, when autumn weather
Had occupied the world for long.
For winter nature craved, however,
Only in January it snowed.
Tatiana wakened in the morning
Was watching how the snow was falling.
It’d covered all the countryside,
The sheds and roofs, the fence and yard.
The panes by ice were decorated,
By silver were embellished trees,
The magpies were enjoying this,
The hills were by snow cover plated.
The winter finally has come,
And fascinates by bliss and calm.

II

IIt’s winter! And a solemn peasant
Is laying pathway on a sleigh.
His horse scents snow and looking pleasant
Is slowly trotting in some way.
The fluffy furrows pushing high
A dashing cart is speeding by;
In a sheepskin with red sash tied
A coachman sits on a cart’s height.
On a snowed road a boy is running.
He pulls a sled like is a horse
And drives a doggy at full force;
He’s frosted finger, but it’s funny,
Despite the pain he doesn’t stop play;
His mother gestures from away.

III

But, maybe, pictures of that kind
Do not make interest to you,
Since they of primitive remind
And don’t depict a gorgeous view.
By god of inspiration blessed
Another poet earned success,
In gorgeous style first snow described
And winter’s splendid bliss admired.
He’ll fascinate you, beyond doubt,
Depicting by his ardent rhymes
The secret winter troika’s rides;
But insofar, I see no ground
To strive with him or whom you know
As pretty Finish young girl’s beau!

IV

Tatiana (purely Russian creature,
Though, did not know, why is it so)
Adorned by the cold beauty’s features
Admired Russian winter, snow
And hoarfrost in a sunny day,
The sleigh rides and a late dawn play,
When snow is painted in pink color,
And Christmas eve’s majestic cover.
By ancient rite they celebrated
These eves at home and all the maids
From all the Larina’s estates
Were used to guess what’s to them fated,
And to Tatiana every year
Promised far trip and cavalier.

V

Tatiana trusted in the legends
Retained in common people’s rite,
In dreams, card-reading by the maidens,
The prophecies by the moon’s sight.
Her soul by omens was disturbed,
And all the subjects she observed
Something unclear did suggest,
Presentiments constrained her chest.
A mincing cat on stove is staying,
It purrs and washes snout by leg...
No doubt, it’s the omen that
The guests are coming. And when staring
At bicorn new moon’s pretty face,
Exactly on the left hand place,

VI

She started shivering and paling.
And when a falling star in sky
Making it’s quiet magic sailing
Dispersed still being in a fly,
Tatiana in confusion hurried
To whisper what her heart desired,
Unless the star was still in flight.
And when it happened her to sight
A black monastic on the way
Or a fast hare crossing a road
Among the fields she had to hold,
She didn’t know what to do in scare;
And full of premonitions, sad,
She was awaiting something bad.

VII

You know, Tatiana found relish
Even in absolutely dread...
That’s what the nature has established
To contradictions being glad.
The Christmastide has come. All fine!
For fortune telling its prime time.
It entertains the adolescents,
Who have not learned the being lessons
And think that life is light forever.
The same through glasses do the olds,
Who now are reaching the gravestones
And will gain nothing, never ever;
But all the same, to them the hope
Is lying by a baby talk.

VIII

Tatiana by a curious look
Watches the wax sunk in the water.
A finely molded magic hook
Promises to her something obscure.
And on a silver water pane
The rings appear by magic train;
And one of these she’s taking out,
When ancient song to her announced...
“The peasants there are rich and wealthy,
They shovel silver by a spade;
He, whom I sing, is a good mate,
I glory him!” Yet, not be healthy
It promises; because of that
The maids prefer The Pussy Cat.

IX

The night is frosty, sky is clear,
The lamps of night on magic dome
By divine train in calm appear.
Tatiana to the yard from home
Is coming out in light clothing,
A mirror to the moon is turning.
The moon is showing its pale face
In the dark glass, and nothing else.
Hark... snow is squeaking ... passerby;
To him on tiptoe Tanya speeds;
Her voice in dark just sings, not speaks,
It is more tender than of pipe...
What is your name? He’s looking on
And gives an answer... Agafon.

X

Tatiana on advice of nanny
Intended reading cards at night,
In secret she arranged in banya
A fortune telling lonely site.
But sudden fear has seized Tatiana...
And I, remembering Svetlana,
Feel feared as well and that is why
To tell her fortune dare not try.
A sash of silk the girl took off;
Undressed and slipped into a bed,
Lel spins and twists above her head.
I wonder what she’s dreaming of.
It’s calm; under a downy pillow
There is a fortune telling mirror.

XI

About what is dreaming Tanya?
She’s dreaming that she’s quite alone,
Walks by a clearing’s snowy cover
Like in a doleful shadow drawn;
In the snowdrifts on Tanya’s way
Makes noise and splashes by the wave
With ice not bonded gray-haired stream.
It runs and bubbles making steam.
Two thin poles bonded by the ice
Provide a shaky baleful cross;
They lay above the fatal fosse.
She stops at it and puzzled tries
To guess appropriate escape,
But no decision she can make.

XII

Tatiana murmurs at the spring
Perceiving it as separation;
She fails to find anything
That can resolve her hesitation.
But suddenly a snowdrift moved,
And what was it in snowdrift’s groove?
A bear, a big disheveled bear;
Tatiana ah! What a night mare!
But it a paw with sharp long claws
Extended to her; she with caution
Decided to accept this option
And with a fear leaned on the paw.
She crossed the stream and went ahead,
But hears behind the bear’s step!

XIII

She’s scared to look behind and
Avoids to glance at scary shaggy.
She promptly quickens hasty gait,
But cannot get rid of the lackey.
The awful bear groans, falls the trees,
It’s doing that and does not cease.
The pines are rising to the skies,
Their branches by decor of ice
Are loaded, and the lamps of night
Are beaming brightly through the branches
Of naked birches, ashes, aspens.
There is no road in thicket site,
The bushes, chutes and all of those
By blizzard snowed stay in a drowse.

XIV

Tatiana to the forest dashes;
The bear behind, she’s in fear;
Here a long bough her collar catches,
There golden earring drops from ear.
Here, a deep snow pulls of a boot
From her so lovely little foot;
There, being in a panic haste
She drops a handkerchief; to waste
Even few seconds she cannot,
Since hears behind the bear’s breathing;
Her heart is trembling, she is seeking
For an escape, and all for naught.
She’s running, but it chases her,
And she has no force to run more.

XV

She falls on snow; the bear doesn’t wait,
It grabs her quickly and speeds on;
She is afraid a breath to take,
Her heart has sunk, she’s scared to turn.
It speeds; now on a forest way
There is a cabin roofed with hay;
Thickets around, dark and snow,
The cot in mystery is drawn.
The light is shining in the window,
She hears the strangers’ cries and noise.
The bear announced... stay with those,
Here is my friend, have a good evening!
It opens squeaky entrance door
And puts Tatiana on the floor.

XVI

She’s come to senses, looks and sees...
There is no bear, she’s in a lobby.
Behind a door the cries and clinks,
Like at a burial ceremony.
Not understanding what it is,
She peeps through chink, and what she sees?
The beasts are sitting at the table;
They cry and noise like in a fable.
One with the horns and doggy muzzle,
The other with a rooster’s head,
A witch with beard behaves like mad,
Here something making just a puzzle,
A dwarf with tail and besides that
A half a crane and half a cat.

XVII

The others are more odd, more scary...
A crawfish sits on spider’s head,
A goose’s neck a scull does carry,
Which spins inside a reddish hat;
A windmill flaps and cracks by wings
And in a squat dance jumps and spins.
Bark, laughter, singing, whistle, scamper,
And people’s talk, and horses’ clatter!
But who is sitting over there,
Among the monsters and the beasts?
Yes, Tanya my tale’s hero sees,
Whom she adores, who causes scare!
Onegin is among them sitting
And at the door furtively flicking.

XVIII

He gives a sign - gets what asks for,
He drinks - the same does all the gang,
He starts to laugh - and they guffaw,
He starts to frown - they make a brake.
He is a master, it is clear,
And Tanya does not feel so feared,
And feeling braver and less shy
She’s peeping through the door ajar...
But suddenly a wind did puff,
And all the lights at once blue out,
The gang of beasts the girl has found.
Onegin pushes off the stuff.
The company gets up and waits,
The master to the door directs.

XIX

And she is scared and is attempting
To run away, but can’t do that.
She is in panic, close to fainting
And tries to cry, but fails to get
Away. Door opens, Eugene looks,
As well as all infernal spooks,
At the poor virgin; they guffaw,
Their gazes are just burning her.
The hoofs and awful crooked trunks,
The fearful tusks and violent fangs,
The whiskers, horns and crested tails,
The bony fingers, bloody tongs,
All these are pointed to her,
They shout... mine! And all guffaw.

XX

It’s mine! announced Eugene sternly,
The gang flashed on and disappeared.
And only the young girl stands lonely
With Eugene by the dark concealed.
Onegin gently brings Tatiana
To seclude corner and puts down
On an unsteady shaky bed,
And on her shoulder bends his head...
All of a sudden Olga enters,
Then, Lensky comes; the light flashed on;
Onegin raised his hand with moan,
His eyes express an evil sentence,
He swears the uninvited guests;
In bed Tatiana half-live rests.

XXI

The quarrel flares, all of a sudden
A long sharp knife in Eugene’s hand
Flashed coldly and a victim found,
Threw down Lensky, after that
Someone hysterically cried.
All disappeared... Tatiana sighed.
She looks around - all is fine.
The frozen panes of windows shine
By crimson beams of the sunrise.
Door opens; who’s there? Olga calling;
She’s worth of this amazing morning,
Gets inside like a swallow flies.
“How are you? Fine, then, tell me please,
Whom did you see in your night dreams?”

XXII

The elder does not see the minor
And with a book still stays in bed,
She turns one page after another,
All her attention switched to that.
We know, this book does not depict
Neither a honey poet’s think,
Nor a wise truth or a nice scene
Composed by Virgil or Racine,
Or Scott, or Byron or Seneca,
Yet, wasn’t it Ladies Magazine,
We wonder what she’s looking in.
My friends, it was Martyn Zadeka,
Chaldean sage, who clarifies
Meaning of dreams and other signs.

XXIII

It was a country migrant merchant,
Who came to the estate sometimes
And this invaluable creation
Brought with a bunch of other wise
And entertaining books, at that
To them a great discount made...
Gave up for three and point five!
Besides, for them he also hired
A set of vulgar folkish fables,
Two Petriadas, grammar, then
The volume three by Marmontel.
Martin Zadeka was the famous,
With him Tatiana always sleeps,
It comforts and the sorrow treats.

XXIV

She is disturbed by her night dreaming.
She wants to know what does it sign,
What is this fearful dreaming meaning?
That’s what she tries to clarify.
Tatiana in a brief contents
Checks for the words complied with sense...
Pine forest, shadow, tempest, gale,
Witch, hedgehog, snowdrift, cot, fir, bear.
But all in vain, Martyn Zadeka
Cannot resolve misgivings, yet,
Sad premonitions does preset,
The future troubles would be fatal.
And for a few days after that
She couldn’t this awful dream forget.

XXV

The sunrise stretches crimson arm
To rise the sun from morning vale,
Besides, it starts the joy and fun -
Tatiana’s January name-day!
Since early morning Larin’s manor
Is full of guests... the friends and neighbors
Have come by carriages, by cabs,
By hooded carts, by open sleds.
In a front room it’s crush and bustle,
And in a drawing room they meet
Newcomers; all of them they greet.
Barking of pugs, noise, laughter, hustle,
Bows, misses' kisses, shuffling, jam,
The kids’ and nurses’ cries and cram.

XXVI

Accompanied by portly spouse
Has arrived stout Triflyakoff,
Gvozdin - a landlord fair and nice,
The owner of the pauper serfs,
The Beastoffs couple, gray and sage,
With children of the plural age
(From two to thirty years of old),
Then, local dandy Roosteroff,
My uncle’s son Mr. Ruffianoff
In down and in a peaked hat
(I bet, for sure, you know that),
And ex-advisor Mr. Flyanoff -
A heavy gossip, old buffoon,
Bribe taker, glutton and fair fool.

XXVII


Here’s family of Pygmykoff
Accompanied by French Trike -
Wise cracker, newly from Tambov,
In glasses and fake reddish hair.
Like real French, he in his pocket
To Tanya brought a famous couplet,
The one, which even kids did hear...
Reveillez-vous, belle endormie.
On almanac’s by time worn pages
This couplet sometimes he observed
And had decided... it deserved
To be extracted from the ages.
And there, instead of oh, belle Nina
Inserted boldly oh, belle Tania.

XXVIII

And, wow! From local town’s suburb
A company commander comes,
For mature maidens he is superb
Inspiring hopes of local mums.
Gets in... and what a thrill he’s stirring...
He’s brought the orchestra, no kidding!
Yes, it will play! It was the colonel,
Who gave the necessary order!
The misses frisk expecting something.
But meal is served, and in a row
The guests proceed to dining-hall.
The girls are at Tatiana hustling;
The men in front; the crowd drones,
And crossing to the table goes.

XXIX

The talks are postponed for a while;
The mouths chew, and in the room
The dishes clatter and the wine
Streams in the glasses clinking cool.
But little by little and the quiet
Was changed by overall excite.
Nobody hears; the noise and shouts,
They argue, laugh, make funny sounds.
All of a sudden Lensky enters,
Onegin follows after him;
The mistress shouts... “Oh, my dear!”
The guests start moving to sit denser;
They shift the glasses, dishes, chairs
To put the friends at the right place.

XXX

They place them opposite my dear,
Who is like morning moonlight pale
And feared like a chased fallow deer;
To glance at him she does not dare;
She is in fever, she’s amazed,
She feels unwell, her breast high raised.
Poor girl doesn’t hear the two friends’ greeting;
She’s suffocating, heavy breathing;
The tears are close to drop from eyes,
She’s close to fall into a faint.
But will and mind had prevailed,
And, thus, she finally pronounced
Through set teeth just a couple words,
And remained sitting afterwards.

XXXI

The tragic-nervous demonstrations,
The ladies’ faints and bitter tears
Stirred in Eugene just no reactions,
He had experienced lots of these.
The stranger at this giant feast
Was irritated besides this;
He noticed languid maiden’s burst,
His glance under the table cast,
And in a sulk made a decision
And vowed that he will take revenge
And Lensky properly enrage.
And now rejoicing in his vision
The future triumph coming soon
Inwardly drew the guests cartoon.

XXXII

Not only my Eugen of course
Saw poor Tatiana’s perturbation,
But fatty pasty that time was
In epicenter of attention
(Unfortunately over-salted).
And, wow, they bring so nicely bottled
Chilled sparkling wine; yes, it was served
Between beefsteak and cold dissert
And was escorted by the glasses
Slender and long like waist of thee...
Zizi, do you remember me?
You were a subject of my verses,
Whom I remember and admire,
And who with no wine could inspire!

XXXIII

A bottle made a loud pop,
Got rid of humid cork, and wine
Is making hiss; Trike can’t stop
To chew the couplet in his mind;
Stands up adopting pompous bearing,
The guests in silence wait his saying.
Tatiana feels like a half dead;
Trike with paper in his hand
Starts singing falsely. Splashes, screaming
Reward the singer. Tanya can’t
Avoid to drop a curtsy; and
The poet, who is great and pleasing,
Is first to drink to Tanya’s health
And hands to her his pearl himself.

XXXIV

Regards, congratulations, speeches,
Tatiana’s thanks for all of that...
But when the turn Onegin reaches,
The maiden's face looked so much sad,
So much confused and so fatigued
That pity in his soul conceived...
He stood up, gave a bow to her
In silence complementing, though
His gaze was wonderfully pensive;
It looked like he was really moved,
Though, play or pranks I can’t exclude,
But it was really expressive,
Involuntary or good willed.
Tatiana’s heart he really stirred.

XXXV

The chairs are moved and in a squeeze
In drawing room the people crowds,
Like from a hive a swarm of bees
Is flying to the blooming grounds.
And being pleased by festive table
A neighbor sniffs in front a neighbor,
The ladies sit by fireside,
The damsels whisper getting quiet;
The green card tables are extended
And call the boisterous old man
To ombre, Boston, whist, as well,
Which till today is highly valued.
What can I tell you of these games...
They are the greedy boredom’s heirs.

XXXVI

The fans of whist eight rubbers played,
In other words, twenty four rounds,
And thus, eight times positions changed.
And tea is served; and I have found...
It’s nice to check the time of day,
By breakfast, dinner and tea brake;
That’s how the country fuss without
Replaces Breguet watch by stomach;
And, by the way, I note in brackets
That in my rhymes you often meet
The scenes of dinners and of feast,
The dishes, corks and petty matters.
That is, by what divine Homer
Impresses us three thousand years!

XXXVII XXXVIII XXXIX

But tea is served... the maidens slowly
The cups on saucers just picked up,
When suddenly somewhere from doorway
Bassoon and flute at once did start.
Being by music roar inspired,
The tea with liquor has exiled
Paris of all the local place,
Rusteroff, Olga calls to dance,
Lensky - to Tanya, Pygmykova,
The over mature fiance,
Is engaged by Tambov’s Trike,
Ruffianoff speeds by Triflyakova.
The hall is crowded with the guests,
The ball is shining in the best.

XL

In the beginning of my tale
(Please, note the chapter number one)
I planned like Alban to explain
How at the balls the nobles fun.
Yet, entertained by hollow dreams
(The recollection interferes)
Depicted charming females’ legs
Of pretty girls and well known dames.
Oh, legs, enough to dream of you!
The youthful bliss has passed forever
I should be wise, I should be clever,
The deals and rhymes I shall review.
And now, in chapter number five
I shouldn’t digressions exercise.

XLI

Monotonous and always thoughtless,
Like whirl of passionate young years,
The waltz is spinning, by the circles
The couples flicker in the dance.
The vengeance time accelerating,
Completing evil undertaking
Onegin comes to Olga, then
To whirl with her at guests began,
Then on a padded chair her places
And starts to talk of this of that.
Two minutes later after that
The end of waltz with her he dances.
All are amazed, Lensky surprised
And can’t believe to his own eyes.

XLII

Mazurka started. I remember,
How it did thunder in a hall,
When the environment did tremble,
The parquet uttered loud groan,
The glasses tinkled in the frames;
No more, however, nowadays,
We like the ladies glide the boards.
But at the province town's courts
Mazurka still is in the prime,
And to the front till now it places
Moustaches, hills and special graces.
It is the same, the passing time
Cannot change that despite of fashion,
Which kills the old with no compassion.

XLIII XLIV

Ruffianoff, who’s my ardent brother,
Both sisters brings to my Eugene,
But he, at that, prefers the minor,
And she agrees to dance with him.
He slides with her and whispers something,
And bends to her with ardor glancing,
Recites poor madrigal, shows charm,
And squeezes gently Olga’s arm.
He has brought her to exaltation,
Her cheeks and neck like roses flare.
But Lensky blushed, could not that stay...
He’s jealous, flushed by indignation,
And finally, when music ends,
Invites her to cotillion dance.

XLV

But she can’t do it. No? But why?
Since to Eugene she gave her word.
How could it be, she looked so shy!
What does he hear, my God, my Lord!
Is she a baby or coquette?
What shall he do with all of that!
To be so cunning, to betray,
To be unfaithful, who would say!
And Lensky can’t withstand the stroke.
He curses women's pranks and tricks,
Gets out fast, to his steed springs
And gallops being deadly shocked.
Two bullets only now await -
They will resolve the poet’s fate.


Chapter VI

I

Had noticed that Vladimir vanished
Onegin was by boredom chased
And being satisfied by vengeance
Began to think of something else.
And Olga too had started yawning,
Cotillion was so long and boring,
It languished her like troubling dream;
Why did Vladimir disappear?
The dance was over; supper followed,
And they arranged for staying guests
Night lodging and a place to rest
From maiden’s room to lobby hallway.
Since people need to have repose;
Onegin left for home, of course.

II

The guests calmed down... in the study
Is snoring heavy Triflyakoff
Accompanied by sweetheart body.
Ruffianoff, Gvozdin, Rusteroff
And Flyanov, being not fine fettle,
In dining room on chairs have settled.
Trike is lying on the floor
In the old cap and camisole.
In rooms of Olga and Tatiana
The maidens are embraced by dreams,
Just Tanya isn’t among of these.
She’s at the window, and Diana
Illuminates her doleful face;
She’s looking at an obscure space.

III

Onegin’s sudden apparition,
The instant tenderness of eyes,
With Lensky unexpected friction,
With Olga strange behave, besides,
By all what happened she is puzzled.
She is disturbed, her soul is troubled
By jealous anguish and depression.
It looks like someone’s hand compression
Squeezes her heart and does remind
A chasm, which is so dark and sad...
“I’ll perish”, Tanya faintly said,
“But perish from him I won’t mind.
He can’t make happy me, that’s why
I shouldn’t murmur, why should I?”

IV

Full speed ahead, ahead my story!
I should new character conceive...
Five miles away from Krasnogorie
(The Lensky’s village) used to live,
And does it well till nowadays
In philosophic desert place,
Zaretsky, sometimes hooligan,
The gambling gangsters ataman,
Scapegraces‘ head, tribune of taverns,
But now a kind easy man,
Paterfamilias (single), then,
Trustworthy friend, landowner sound,
And I should add an honest man...
That’s how the century does mend!

V

Some years ago in high society
His evil courage brought him fame,
Since shooting ace from gun he lightly
Did strike a bullet in the aim.
And more than that, once in a battle
He tried in rush with foe to settle,
Excelled and straight into the mud
Fell from a horse, since was dead drunk;
And by the Frenchmen being captured
(It was a valuable bail!)
Like Roman hero did unveil
His courage ready to be tortured.
Thus, every evening at Very
He drained the bottles, two or three.

VI

He used sometimes to ridicule
And pool the wool over the eyes,
Of a smart man could make a fool
Doing it straight or otherwise.
Though, like all other spiteful jesters,
He learned sometimes the bitter lessons,
It happened, he got trapped as well,
And like a simpleton he fell.
He could be funny, cheer by quarrel,
Could respond keenly or look dull,
Could hold his tongue or make it fun,
Sometimes, the common sense could follow,
Could cause to quarrel the young men,
To duel barrier bring them, then,

VII

To reconcile them, then for triple
To organize a friendly lunch,
And after that defame in secret
By the light jest or other lies.
Sed alia tempora! Thus, boldness
(Like dream of love or other nonsense)
With the young years is slipping by
And my Zaretsky that is why
From storms escaped now lives in peace
The life of real ancient sage,
And covered by acacia shades,
Seeds cabbage like Horace in Greece,
And breeding ducks and geese at that
Teaches to kids the alphabet.

VIII

He was not dumb, that’s why Onegin,
Though didn’t perceive his talents well,
Esteemed his spirit, also valued
His sound talk of this of them.
Onegin met him, and not once
Was pleased to talk with him and, thus,
Was not at all this time surprised,
When saw him coming with sunrise.
Zaretsky after the first greeting
The conversation briefly ended,
Then, archly smiled, his hand extended
With a note by the poet written.
Onegin came to window and
The letter silently had scanned.

IX

It was a noble, even pleasant
What they were used to call cartel,
Politely, like a chilly pedant,
Lensky sent challenge to his pal.
Onegin with no extra motions,
Without questions or emotions
And with no words unnecessary
Said briefly that he’s always ready.
Zaretsky didn’t need explanations,
To stay for long he did not will,
And having lots of things to deal
Had left with no clarifications.
But with his soul at tete-a-tete
Onegin didn’t like all of that.

X

It serves me right, he thought when judging
Himself at conscience secret court,
His own behavior criticizing
Excuse for what he’d done he sought;
How could he play this spiteful trick
And make the bashful soul so sick!
And why to play in love should not
A poet who’s eighteen years old?
It is excusable. Eugene,
Who loved the youth by all his soul,
Should at that time his person show
Not as a bigot, but be keen
As real sage and noble man,
Whose mind is above fake shame.

XI

He should nobility uncover
Instead of bristling up like beast;
He should disarm the younger brother,
Calm down burning heart at least.
“But now too late, the time flew by...
Besides, this old duelist guy
Has interfered; and he is mean,
A scandalmonger, that’s the deal...
Of course, his words should cause despise,
They are just stupid, nothing more,
But whisper and the fools’ guffaw...
To lose your face - that is the price...”
We can’t ignore the public spirit,
On which the modern world is spinning!

XII

With enmity the poet seethes
At home awaiting for response,
But now, the pompous neighbor brings
A formal answer... yes, of course.
The jealous man can celebrate,
Since all that time he was afraid
That the arch person will somehow
Laugh off and thus escape, but now
He has no chance for duel skipping,
All settled. Thus a plan they make...
Tomorrow morning at daybreak
At the old mill to have a meeting,
They’ll cock the pistols, after that
Will aim each other’s thigh or head.

XIII

And Lensky in his mind seething
Decided to despise the flirt,
Ignore her before fatal meeting.
He watched the sun, the clock. And what?
Threw it away, and after all
Found himself at neighbors’ home.
He thought that Olga would be troubled
And by his visit would be puzzled.
But he was wrong... as always merry
Like nothing bad she ever did,
She sprang from porch the guest to greet
Being like flighty hope, like fairy,
So lively, cheerful and carefree,
As in the past she used to be.

XIV

“Why yesterday you’d vanished early?”
That’s what she asked the guest at first.
The question made Vladimir sorry,
He could not give a right response.
And under her angelic stare
All his resentment flew away,
How could he innocence withstand,
This lively soul misunderstand?
He looks at her in sweet oblivion
And thinks that he is beloved still,
Repentance brings his soul to thrill,
He wants show mercy, he’s obedient,
He trembles, cannot find words,
He is just happy, no more odds...

XV XVI XVII

But, then, again reflective, gloomy
In front of Olga, nice and fair,
Vladimir was not able, truly,
To speak about yesterday.
“I'll save her from the evil torture,
I won’t let terrible debaucher
Seductive talent exercise
And virgins catch by praise and sighs;
I won’t let toxic worm to gnaw
The morning lily blossom’s stem,
I won’t let flower to wane,
When it’s best time for it to grow”.
So far as I can understand,
He’s shooting with his former friend.

XVIII

If he could at that time compare
His wound with my Tatiana’s sorrow!
Would ever she had been aware
Of what he’s planning for tomorrow,
That Lensky sent Onegin challenge,
And both of them were close to perish!
Ah, maybe then her love and pain
Would make them bosom friends again!
Nobody at that time discovered
This unexpected passion, yet,
In secret Tanya pined of that,
Onegin was as always silent;
Tatiana’s nanny was aware,
But was not smart enough to care.

XIX

Vladimir was in absent mind,
Now taciturn, then, gay again,
Since poets by their Muse inspired
Are all like that, and he’s the same;
He frowned, tried to play clavichord,
But managed only one accord,
Then cast at Olga vivid eyes
And faintly whispered... isn’t it nice?
But it was late and time for leaving;
And bidding farewell to the girl
He felt the trouble overall,
His heart was close to tear in grieving.
She glanced at him. “What’s going on?”
He answered - Nothing. - And was gone.

XX

When being home, he checked the pistols,
Then put them back into the case.
He took off dress and with persistence,
By grievous premonitions chased,
Tried to read Schiller, yet, in vain,
He failed to turn sad thoughts away...
Just Olga occupied his soul,
Her view disturbed him more and more.
Vladimir closes Schiller’s book
And takes a pen to write the verses,
The rhymes are full of loving nonsense,
They ring and pour at the lone nook.
He recites them in sweet oblivion,
Like drunken Delvig in delirium.

XXI

By chance I have retained these verses
And can recite them, here are they...
“Where are the days of my life blossom?
The golden youth has passed away!
What’s planning to me coming morning?
My gaze in vain attempts foreknowing.
It’s hidden in the obscure haze.
The fortune law is always sage.
Should I fall down punched with arrow,
Or flying by it will pass me?
All deeds are blessing, let it be,
The day and night, delight and sorrow
Change one another... it’s the law
That darkness obscures bright day glow.

XXII

A, morning beam will flash tomorrow
A vivid day will start to play.
And I, maybe, by sad doom followed
Shall fall into the beyond stay.
And all, what of me can remind,
Will be erased from human’s mind.
But you, the beauty all above,
Would you, sometimes, esteem my love?
Would you pour tears, and think of me,
And whisper visiting my urn...
He’d perished at the early dawn,
And all his youth he hallowed me!
My cordial friend, my beloved wife,
Please come to me and share my life!..”

XXIII

That’s how he wrote, inertly, gloomy,
(And we call this romanticism?
I do not see here any, truly,
Though, I am far from criticism.)
But finally, before sunrising
He stopped his talent exercising,
And searching for a rhyme in verse
He’d fallen into half a drowse;
But just he fell into oblivion
And by Morpheus was embraced
And by alarming dreaming chased,
Here is this scandalmongers’ minion...
“It’s over six and time to go,
Onegin should not wait for long”.

XXIV

But he was wrong... that time Onegin
At home was sleeping like a log.
The night time shades have started fading,
And Vesper is hailed by a cock.
But he is sleeping and doesn’t care.
The sun is rising over there,
And snow is whirled by sudden blow,
It spins and shines, the day starts glow.
He stays in bed and does not mind
Watching a dream, he’s in a drowse,
But finally he is aroused
And leaves the bed, raises the blinds.
He looks and sees, that long ago
He should leave home and now must go.

XXV

He rings a bell; here is his servant -
Frenchman Gilliotte is coming in,
He brings the dressing gown, and toilet,
And bedroom shoes, and serves to him.
In rush Onegin dresses up
And asks the servant to catch up,
A case with pistols to prepare
And of the duel be aware.
A racing sleigh waits at the entrance,
He gets on, and they start the ride
And shortly to the mill arrived.
He gives to servant the directions...
To bring the barrels and besides,
To move the horses to safe site.

XXVI

Was waiting there for a long time.
Zaretsky, rural engineer,
Was criticizing mill design.
"What’s going on, and where is that,
Who’ll be your second?” - neighbor said.
He was the duels doctrinaire
And loved to follow the rules strictly.
A duel must by just and fair,
A person should be slain with care
According to the rules and neatly,
Just like the olds established that
(For this he earns my compliment).

XXVII

“Here is my second - Eugene said. -
I can’t foresee any objection,
Monsieur Guillot is my best friend,
You cannot claim any rejection;
And though he is unknown to you
He’s honest fellow, that’s for sure”.
Zaretsky held his scathing tongue
And had accepted that demand.
“Well, shall we start?” - applied Onegin.
- I think, we shall, - Vladimir said.
They to the mill their steps direct.
Zaretsky and the honest fellow
Have settled an important deal.
Have dropped the eyes, the foes stand still.

XXVIII

Are they the foes?! For how long they
Thirst for the blood and are in quarrel?
How long ago they used to share
Their pastime, meals, plans for tomorrow?
The former friends are full of bile,
As pushed by the ancestral rite,
Like in a bad and obscure dream
They stay in front in calm and dim
Preparing perish to each other.
But should not they just start to laugh
Before a hand is stained with blood?
Shouldn’t they try peace way to discover?
But enmity in high-society
Is always by false shame excited.

XXIX

The pistols sparkled at a distance,
A hammer at a ramrod nocks,
The bullets sink in tubes of pistols,
And for the first time clicks a cock.
Gunpowder leaves a greyish track,
When being poured on pistol’s rack.
The well-fixed flints are cocked upright;
Guillot drew back to a safe site
(He looks upset and pretty harassed).
They throw the cloaks to free the hands,
Thirty two steps Zaretsky spans;
He’s strict and not at all embarrassed.
He draw the friends to the last step
And they take pistols after that.

XXX

“That’s it, now go”. And in cold mind
Not aiming one another, yet,
They started to approach in quiet
By steady, firm and sound gait.
They made the first four dreadful stairs,
Onegin was the first to raise
His pistol slowly on the walk
And pressed his finger to the cock.
When five more steps they both had made,
Vladimir screwing up left eye
Began to aim, but at that time
Onegin shot... The clock of fate
Has chimed for Lensky by grave sound.
He drops the pistol on the ground,

XXXI

Then puts his hand on chest and slowly
Falls on the snow. His hazy eyes
Not torture show, by death are glowing.
It’s like a mass of snow and ice
With sparkles at the bright sun shining
From a hill’s slope is slowly sliding.
With icy cold instantly poured,
To Lensky Eugene quickly moved.
He looks at him and calls... It’s awesome...
He’s perished. The young poet’s fate
Has turned to the untimely death!
A storm did breathe, the charming blossom
Has faded at the early dawn,
The altar’s sacred flame has gone!

XXXII

He lies immovable, his brow
Looks very languishing and weird.
The bullet went through chest and now
The blood from smoking wound does bleed.
And just an instant far ago
The poet’s soul was still aglow
With enmity, and hope, and love,
The life was sparkling stirring blood.
Like a deserted home remains
Without noise, without light,
In silence all the day and night.
The shutters locked, the window panes
Are whitewashed, there is no more host.
Where is he? God knows. He is lost.

XXXIII

It's nice to rage embarrassed foe
By bold and biting epigram;
It’s nice to see that he doesn’t more
Intend to play or to make fun,
Declines his horns and sees his face,
But to admit it feels disgrace.
It’s nice, my friend, when you can see
How he, like foolish, cries... it’s me!
And even nicer with persistence
To plan to him untimely death
And aim at his pallid forehead
At nobly measured sound distance;
Yet, to make him a really dead
You scarcely would be too much glad.

XXXIV

What will you feel, when it was you
Who’ve shot a young and pleasant pal,
Who by response, immodest view
Or any other bagatelle
Insulted you over a bottle
Or being by a nuisance throttled
Proudly challenged you to fight?
Would ever you feel satisfied
And would be glad to see a body,
Which lies immovable on earth?
On fading brow you see the death,
It stiffens, ossifies; nobody
Replies to your hopeless request,
He’s deaf and mute, and nothing else.

XXXV

Thus, tortured by the conscience pangs,
The pistol squeezing in his hand,
At Lensky stricken Eugene stares.
“That’s that, he’s killed”, - the neighbor said.
He’s killed! This dreadful exclamation
Produced in Eugene bad vibration.
He steps aside, for people calls.
Zaretsky Lensky’s body rolls
Into his cloak, like dreadful treasure,
Puts on a sleigh the frozen corps.
The horse when feeling dead man snorts,
Drops lather, thrashes like in seizure,
The iron bits makes wet and bites,
And like a flying arrow rides.

XXXVI

Yes, for the poet you feel sorry...
In blossom of the cheerful hopes
He hasn’t fulfill his dream of glory,
Just getting rid of swaddling clothes.
He’s faded! Where’s his excitation,
Romantic noble aspiration,
And thoughts and feelings of young man,
High, lofty, tender, daring, fair?
Where are the stormy amorous passions,
And thirst for knowledge and for work,
And shame of vice and other fault,
And cherished hopes, and bright impressions,
Unearthly dreams, and sweet delusions,
And sacred poetry’s illusions?

XXXVII

But, maybe, for the world’s well-being,
At least, for fame he was conceived;
His silenced lyre if not stopped singing
Could be high valued and esteemed,
And glory him in future ages;
And, maybe, on the public stages
He could achieve a supreme grade.
And, maybe, his unhappy shade
Has hidden entity, when leaving,
Which makes a mystery to us,
Life-giving voice has died, alas;
Beyond the threshold of the being
The anthem of the future tribes
Will never mention it sometimes.

XXVIII XXXIX

Though, also different could happen,
A common fate could await him,
The poet’s talent could die latent
Or with the years would just get dim.
In many aspects he would vary,
He would leave muses and get married.
In quilted robe the rest of life
Would be a cuckold at his wife.
He’d learn what human life is really,
In forty would fall ill with gout,
He’d eat, drink, bore, decay, grow stout,
And finally in bed while dreaming
Would die in peace among his kids,
The whining skirts and healing prigs.

XL

No matter what could be, my reader,
Alas, but the young paramour,
Romantic pal and pensive dreamer
Is killed by friendly hand, for sure!
There is a place nearby to mansion,
Where dwelled the kid of inspiration...
Two pines by roots together merge,
A brook meandering there flows
Emerging from a nearby valley.
It is a place for ploughmen’s rest,
Where reapers use to play and jest
And dip the jugs, where pipe is playing.
There, at the brook in shade of limes
Today a simple gravestone lies.

XLI

Just here (when on the shoots of fields
Begins to drip refreshing rain),
A shepherd weaving bast shoe sings
A song of Volga’s fishermen.
And a young lady - city dweller,
Who to the country likes to travel,
When rides headlong in fields alone
Uses to stop at the gravestone.
She stops the horse by the reins drawing.
There is inscription on the stone,
It is what she is looking on.
Her reading fluent eyes are fogging.
She’s reading epitaph, at that
Her tender eyes are getting wet.

XLII

Being immersed into the dreaming
She slowly rides by open fields.
The Lensky’s fate against the willing
For long disturbs her thoughts and feels.
She thinks... “What is now Olga doing?
And wasn’t she by this trouble ruined
Or didn’t grieve much and stopped to pine?
And where’s her sister passing time?
And where is this ambiguous figure,
The trendy foe of trendy belles,
And where today this glum crank stays,
The killer of the youthful singer?”
Sometimes I’ll finish my true tale
And then report you in detail,

XLIII

But not today, though, I sincerely
Do love the hero of my tale,
And shall return to him, believe me,
But now not that disturbs my brain.
The years to severe prose incline,
The years the playful rhyme decline,
And I (confessing with a sigh)
Follow my muse with less excite.
My pen has no more inclination
To stain the flighty paper leaves,
The other, cold prosaic dreams,
The other stern considerations
In the high life’s stir and in calm
Disturb a dream of my soul now.

XLIV

I’ve learned the voice of new desires,
And the new sorrow learned for real,
But for the former - hope expires,
The olden sorrow stirs me still.
Where is the pleasure of my dreams,
Which should be rhymed with youth extremes?
I won't believe, but is at last
The wreath of youth has drooped, alas?
I won’t believe, but is it real,
Without elegiac plays,
That spring of my galloping days
(What I for fun used to reveal)
Will never come again, has gone,
My thirtieth birthday coming on!

XLV

Thus, my midday has come and I
Cannot deny it... yes, it has.
But that’s all right, I say good by
To my light-headed youthful days!
Thank you for pleasure and enjoyments,
For melancholy, lovely torments,
For stir, for tempests and for feasts,
For all, for all your pleasant gifts!
And I am thankful for enjoying
You, both, in disquiet and in quiet;
I have enjoyed, and that’s all right;
Enough! I am my soul employing
In search for other novel way,
To take a rest of former stay.

XLVI

Let me glance back. Farewell to places,
The thickets, where my days did flow,
Suffused with laziness and passions,
With dreams of my reflective soul.
But you, the youthful inspiration,
Remain and stir imagination,
The drowsy heart reanimate,
My lonely nook, please, animate,
Don’t let the poet’s soul to still,
To become hardened and to wane
And finally to live in vain
In high society’s fatal thrill.
This is a pool, my friends, where I
With you take bath and feel so fine!


Chapter VII

I
The snow has left the local highlands
And pepped up by the vernal beams
Has run onto the drowned flood lands
By cheery muddy water streams.
The nature with a smile arousing
Through dream is greeting the year dawning;
The shining sky is blue and clear,
The still bare forests start to green
Like by a down covered lightly.
A bee from waxen cell of hive
For tribute to the fields starts fly.
The valleys dry and blush up brightly.
The flocks make noise, a nightingale
At night starts singing in the dale.

II

How doleful looks to me appearing
Of sacred spring, the time for love!
And what a languishing blessed stirring
It rouses in my soul and blood!
What a sweet heartache I am feeling!
Spring resurrection causes thrilling
When it is blowing on my face
In solitude of rural space!
Is this delight to me uncommon,
And all what gladdens and gives light,
What looks excited and shines bright
Produces languishing and boredom?
And can it be that my soul died,
And spring doesn’t please it, doesn’t excite?

III

Am I not glad to resurrection
Of perished in the autumn leaves
And can remain in sad distraction,
When hearing how a forest breathes?
Or with the nature animation
We do associate frustration
Caused by the years, which passed away
And never will be back again?
Or, maybe, in the mind dreaming,
In midst of the poetic drowse,
Another former spring arouse,
And it produces my heart thrilling
By vision of a nice far place,
The magic night and Luna’s face...

IV

It’s time for you, the idle creatures,
The epicurean-sage men,
Who by indifference are featured,
You, Levshin’s school of being fans,
And you, the countryside Priams,
And sentimental city dames,
The spring attracts to rural sites,
It’s time of warmth, of works, of sighs,
The time of joyful tempting revels,
Of the seductive springtime nights,
Souls’ inspirations and delights.
Ahead, ahead, arrange the travels
By long drive carriage or post-chaise,
Do drag away from city’s gates.

V

And you, my favorable reader,
Please leave the city’s restless site,
Where you spent time in winter season,
And hire a carriage for a drive.
You will be followed by my Muse
And will be by a grove amused
In the estate above a river,
In a nice nook, where my tale’s hero,
Like a sad hermit spent his time,
Where in an estate nearby
Tatiana lived - a naive dreamer.
Eugene now does not dwell there, yet...
The grievous traces he has left.

VI

Along a path in the groves’ shadow
Let us proceed to a small brook,
Which twists and runs on a green meadow
And makes a turn at a nice nook.
It is a place, where nightingale
Sings songs of love in a calm dale.
There you can hear the brook's sweet tone
And see a lonely sad gravestone,
Which’s covered by the old pines’ shadow.
A stranger reads inscription there...
“Vladimir Lensky rests in here,
A youthful poet and bold fellow
(The date reminds when he’d gone)
Please, stay in piece under the stone!”

VII

It happened that an early breeze
Swung a strange wreath above the urn;
It was hanged up on a pine tree
By caring hands of an unknown.
It happened in the late time evenings
Two maidens here were moved by feelings.
And at the grave in the moonlight
They sat embraced and sadly cried.
But nowadays, the sad gravestone
Is not more cared, the former path
Is close to lifeless, there’s no wreath;
Just the same shepherd sings a song.
He weaves a bast shoe; sick and frail,
He stays alone, his hair is gray.

VIII IX X

Oh, Vladimir! Not for long time
She bemoaned over you, alas!
The woe had passed, she stopped to pine
And did not die of grief at last.
The other drove her off distraction,
The other gained her heart’s affection,
By amour flatter conquered her;
An uhlan captured Olga’s soul.
An uhlan lulled her and quite shortly
He led her to the altar’s throne.
She shyly stands under a crown,
Her head is bowed, the eyes blink courtly,
The lips are adorned with a smile;
She feels quite happy, she is fine.

XI

Oh, Vladimir! In the beyond,
In deaf eternity remote
Did you emit a doleful moan
By this unfaithfulness been shocked?
Or being sank into oblivion
The poet sleeps and has no feeling,
And nothing can affect his sleep,
He sleeps in peace, he’s always meek.
Thus, people sink into oblivion
Just stepping over grave’s threshold.
The friends’ and enemies’ escort
Deceases suddenly, the minion
Is still of interest to those,
Who fight for heirloom, spite and curse.

XII

And shortly ringing voice of Olga
Fell silent in the Larins’ home.
The uhlan got an urgent order
And with the wife he had to go.
The mother suffered separation
And being close to hard frustration
Bitterly cried and could not stop.
But Tanya weep and cry could not,
A cloud of a deadly pallor
Had covered her uncheerful face,
When she was at the lobby stairs,
And people hustled in the parlor.
She came to the departing cab
And seeing them looked very sad.

XIII

For long, like through a misty cloud
She followed them by doleful gaze...
She is alone, no one around!
Alas! The friend for many days,
Her darling frisky young companion,
Her confidant and native fellow
By fate is taken far away,
And now they’ll separately stay.
She looks at the deserted garden
And strolls without purpose, sad...
No one can comfort her in that.
Misfortune came all of a sudden.
She cannot get relief and, thus,
Her heart is tearing into parts.

XIV

The solitude is so severe,
The passion flares and burns and pains,
The heart beats faster in a fever
And with Onegin still remains.
She will not see him never-ever,
She must detest him being clever
As brother’s killer, that is why
She mustn't miss him; but, same time...
The poet now is dead, his bride
Belongs to other one and no one
Still thinks of him. The page’s turned over,
The poet’s spirit has expired.
Two hearts, maybe, till recent day
Still feel deep sorrow... But should they?

XV

It’s getting dark. The sky stopped shining.
A beetle buzzed. A brook streamed quiet.
The round dances were expiring.
The fishers kindled smoking fire.
The wind calmed down in the field.
The pallid moon in sky appeared.
We see Tatiana on the road,
In dreams immersed, she walked for long.
She walked and walked, all of a sudden
She saw a mansion from a knoll,
A hamlet, grove and after all
Spread by the river uncared garden.
She looked at it, the unknown place
Stirred up her soul, her heart beat fast.

XVI

She’s in confusion... “Shall I see
His home and garden, or shall not.
He is not here, no one knows me
In the estate, and why should not?”
And being stirred by languish feeling
She looks around holding breathing,
And then with puzzle in her gaze
She enters the abandoned place.
The dogs attacked her barking loud.
She was afraid, and to her cry
The houseboys at once arrived.
They scuffled with the dogs and thundered,
And fighting pushed the dogs away,
And of the damsel took best care.

XVII

“Can you show me the landlord’s mansion?” -
Tatiana asked; the helpful boys
Ran to Anisiya with intention
To take the keys from entrance doors.
Anisiya instantly appears,
And opens entrance doors with keys.
Tatiana enters empty home,
Where my tale’s hero dwelled alone.
She looks around, in a parlor
A cue is resting on a pool,
A lash for riding on a stool
Being forgotten lonely lying.
Babushka says... ”Here’s a fireside,
Where master used to sit in quiet.

XVIII

In winter time, here, he shared table
With deceased Lensky - neighbor lord.
Please, follow me, give me a favor,
That is the master’s room and board,
Here, he ate coffee and reposed,
And listened to bailiff’s reports,
And in the morning read a book;
It was, as well, the old lord’s nook.
Sometimes on Sundays, wearing glasses,
Here, at the window on this stool,
He played with me the card game Fool.”
And she her former master blesses...
“God, let his bones to rest in peace,
And grant his soul salvation, please!”

XIX

Tatiana views all that with pleasure,
Her soul is moved, her eyes get wet;
Abandoned house looks like treasure,
It stirs her heart, she’s pleased by that.
She’s watching in a sweet distress
A darkened lamp, a desk for chess,
A heap of books, a lonely bed,
And over it a Scottish plaid;
The moon’s twilight is in the window
And obscured neighborhood landscape,
Lord Byron’s portrait hanging straight,
And on the right a puzzling figure -
An idol with the clinched crossed hands
With covered by hat dull brow stands.

XX

Tatiana charmed and fascinated
Stays in the stylish cell for long.
But it is late, the light has faded,
The wind starts blowing, it gets cold.
A grove above the river sleeps
The moon beyond the hill has ceased,
The night is falling, time to go,
The pilgrim should now leave back home.
And Tanya hiding agitation,
Yet, not without heave a sigh
Starts her way back in the moonlight.
But before gets an invitation
To visit this deserted dome,
To read here books and stay alone.

XXI

Thus, after farewell to the woman
Tatiana shortly left for home.
But in the next day’s early morning
She was again in the same dome,
And in the lonely silent study
Forgot of all the other worries.
And when at last she was alone,
She could not stand and wept for long.
Then, to the books she paid attention,
She did not notice them before,
And their selection puzzled her,
It was unusual strange collection.
And reading them, a word by word,
She had discovered a new world.

XXII

Onegin did not like much reading,
As we have mentioned at right place,
Yet, there were several proceedings,
Which he excluded from disgrace...
Gyaur’s and Juan’s composer, first,
Plus two-three other novels, most
Depicting modern world and style,
And how a human can survive,
To whom himself makes only treasure,
Who is immoral, selfish, cold,
Who is a dreamer in this world
And loves himself beyond all measure.
Whose spiteful mind is restless,
It always boils, but is useless.

XXIII

On many read by Tanya pages
There are sharp traces of the nails,
At these the intent damsel gazes,
Just that her mind instigates.
Tatiana is in trepidation,
The signs and marks cause rumination...
What caused him wondering and what
He used to highlight and denote?
And she examines with attention
By pencil scribbled words and signs.
All that his image purifies
And shows his real soul’s affection.
The short comments and marks reveal
Onegin’s mind and his feel.

XXIV

And my Tatiana, little by little,
Starts to perceive, thanks God for that,
The man, whom she adores so fatal,
For whom she pines, who makes her sad,
Who is destined to her by fortune...
Is he just odd and harmful person,
A Heaven’s creature, from the Hell
An evil fellow or good man?
And what is he? Is he just fiction,
A worthless phantom with pretense,
A Muscovite, who Harold feigns,
A foreign oddity affliction,
A fancy sayings’ lexicon,
Just parody and nothing more?

XXV

Has she interpreted this riddle?
Has she discovered the true word?
The clock is running, time for leaving,
She should depart from Eugene’s world.
She is returning home by walking,
Where she’s a subject of a talking.
- What shall I do with my Tatiana? -
With groan said the senile mother. -
How can I settle this tough matter?
It’s time to match the elder one,
What can I do, when everyone,
Who made proposal, was rejected...
Point-blank refuse. She always greaves,
And roams alone in woods in fields. -

XXVI

“Isn’t she in love?” - Who can it be?
Ruffianov wooed - reject, alas.
Then, Roosteroff - the same, you see.
Hussar Pykhtin had stayed at us;
How nice he was, how hardly trying,
How courteous and gratifying!
I guessed, perhaps, he’d make a deal.
Alas, again, and all stays still. -
“Good gracious, ma’am! I know way out -
To Moscow, to the fair of brides!
There is a lot of pleasant sites”.
- Oh, my old man, I am in doubt. -
“If you are in a shortage, then,
I can lend money to you, ma’am”.

XXVII

The old ma’am wisdom demonstrating
Approves this rational advice,
And after resource estimating,
The Moscow trip to winter times.
Tatiana hearing this idea
Feels quite a reasonable fear...
It’s always causes great anxiety
To demonstrate to high society,
To all these Circes and spoiled men,
The innocence of rural places,
The delayed speeches and same dresses,
And to provoke derisions then!
It’s fearful! To avoid the thrill
To stay in backwoods looks more real.

XXVIII

She gets up with a morning rise
And hurries to the groves and fields,
And by affected tender eyes
Glances around and, then, speaks...
“Farewell to you, the lovely dales
And woody knolls of native place,
And you, the forests I do love,
And beauty of the sky above,
Farewell to you the joyful nature,
I’m changing your enchanting light
To high life’s noise and vain delight.
Good bye my freedom, coming future
Is vague and obscure; where, what for
I have to go, who can it know?”

XXIX

Her summer walks are getting longer.
Sometimes, a knoll or a small brook
Amazes Tania like a wonder,
She stops for long and holds her look.
And with the groves and lovely vales
Like with her best and beloved friends
She hurries to communicate.
But summer comes to very late.
The golden autumn is arising.
The nature turns to pale and sad
Like offering prepared for death...
The northern wind the clouds driving;
It breathed and howled and here it is,
The magic winter makes us pleased.

XXX

It’s come and scattered, with white bunches
Has decorated knots of trees,
Has hanged on naked bushes’ branches,
By wavy carpets covered fields.
The river banks and river bed
Are leveled with a fluffy plaid.
The frost did sparkle. It is fine,
We greet the pranks of wintertime.
Just Tanya’s heart is in a worry...
She does not greet the winter more,
Doesn’t breathe the frost air as before,
Doesn’t use first snow from roof of banya
For washing shoulders, breast and face...
She hates to leave the native place.

XXXI

The term of leave for long expired,
The last departure day is close.
An old abandoned sleigh required,
Examined, fixed and cleaned from doze.
The string is usual... hooded carts
Drive tightly packaged bags and trunks
Full of the pans, and jugs, and chairs,
The mattresses, preserves in cans,
The feather beds, cocks in the cages,
The basins, pots, and all that stuff,
Which you will never have enough.
And finally they've packed the sledges
And bring eighteen old jades at last.
The maids start weeping, people fuss.

XXXII

They harness to the sleigh the horses.
The breakfast is already cooked.
The stuff is hilled, babushka crosses,
The peasants at the masters look.
An old postilion with a beard
Sits on a scraggy shaggy weed.
The servants gather at the doors
To say good by to their landlords.
They took a seat, the honored carriage
Is creeping sliding off the gate.
“Farewell to peaceable landscape!
Farewell to solitary refuge!
Should I see you again sometimes?..”
The tears do stream from Tanya’s eyes.

XXXIII

When the good willing education
Will be extended, thanks to that
With lapse of time (and calculation
Shows that this forecast is correct,
Five hundred years since now), maybe,
The roads in Russia, probably,
Will change completely and, in fact,
The endless country intersect.
Above the waters iron bridges
Will step erecting wide and high.
We’ll move the mountains and tie
The river beds and high top ridges.
The Christen world will then obtain
The inns for people entertain.

XXXIV

The roads are awful nowadays,
Neglected bridges are too bad,
Bed bugs and fleas at the road stays
Do not let travelers to nap;
There are no inns and catalogues
On walls of huts made of the logs
For nothing tease your appetite,
You can’t avoid a hungry night.
The countryside’s Cyclops, at that,
In front of slowly burning fires
By Russian hammers treat the tires
Of the neat items Europe made.
They bless the ruts of native land
And ditches of the Russian brand.

XXXV

But in the frosty winter time
A drive is effortless and easy.
The roads are flat like is a rhyme
Of senseless song, just little breezy.
Native automedons are perky,
The troika tireless, no jerky,
The milestones switch just one by one
That looks like fence while speedy run.
But Larina was dragging slowly,
To pay for post-chaise she didn’t want,
To use her private string preferred.
My heroine felt sick and lonely.
Thus, they reached Moscow seventh day,
And she was boring all the way.

XXXVI

Yes, they are close to destination,
The golden crosses shine on domes.
The heart is stirred in exaltation,
Here is the city of white-stones.
How pleased was I to see it, brothers,
When semicircles of the gardens,
The belfries, churches, booths and mansions
Appeared in front of me like phantoms!
How often in sad separation,
When I was staying far apart,
Oh, Moscow, you disturbed my heart!
Oh, Moscow, what a great affection
You really rouse in Russian soul!
How many feelings you do call!

XXXVII

The Peter’s Castle with its oaks
Appears in front. It looks so solemn.
It’s proud of the Russian folks...
In vain some time ago Napoleon
By the last fame intoxicated,
Just here, the Kremlin’s key awaited
Expecting to receive bow low;
Yet, Moscow said to him just “No!”,
And did not bring to him confession.
The Moscow Fire he received
Instead of feast, instead of gift
For the perfidious aggression.
From here Napoleon lost in thoughts
Watched how the flame old Moscow bursts.

XXXVIII

Good by, the faded glory’s witness,
The Peter’s Palace. Gee up, straight!
The posts show up white in a distance,
Now we are passing Tverskoy gate.
The sleigh speeds over the potholes,
Passes poor cabins, gardens, stores,
Street lampions, long skirts and boys,
Booths, peasants, sledges, city noise,
Huts, mansions, pharmacies, Cossacks,
Bukharians, boulevards and cloisters,
Cabmen with faces red like lobsters,
Side streets extending to the dark,
Lions on gates and on high domes
Flacks of jackdaws and grey-black crows.

XXXIX XL

This tiresome exhausting driving
Takes a full hour or more.
In a side street a stead is hiding,
Where at the courtyard’s entrance door
The sleigh now stops. They've come to stay
To the old aunt, who’s sick, but fair.
Three years she’s suffering consumption,
But still retains the sense and gumption.
In a torn caftan, wearing glasses,
Holding a sock, a gray Calmyk
Is meeting them. They hear a squeak
By stretched on sofa sick princess.
They start to hug, exchange the kisses
And tell how much each other misses.

XLI

“Pachette!” - Alina, dear Princess! -
“Who could imagine? Oh, my Lord!
How many days and years have passed?
Sit down, darling, it’s so odd!
It looks like novel’s scene, you know ...”
- Here is my elder, Tanya. -“Oh!
Tatiana, dear, come closer, please,
I think all that is in my dreams...
Do you remember Grandison?”
- What, Grandison? How great he was!
I can’t forget him, yes, of course! -
“He dwells not far, at Simeon;
This Eve he came to visit me.
His son just married." - I can see... -

XLII

“And also, yes, ... but let’s talk later.
Please, do not worry, in a day
Tatiana will be represented
To all her kin, though I should stay
At home, since barely drag my feet.
You are exhausted, let’s complete.
It’s time for all of us to rest.
I’m tired too. Oh, my poor chest!
Now even pleasure makes me tired,
Not only sadness... yes, my dear,
I am not good for any deal...
When you are old, life is so vile...”
She was entirely fatigued,
Began to cough and then to weep.

XLIII

Sick auntie’s cuddles and enjoyment
Affect Tatiana; yet, it’s quite
A problematic entertainment
Not in your room to spend a night.
And covered by the silky veils
In a new bed to sleep she fails,
A neighbor belfry’s early toll
(Forerunner of the morning toil)
Rises her up, calls to a window.
Tatiana looks at outdoor
The dusk thins out, but no more
She can see neither wood, nor meadow.
There’s unknown yard in front of her,
A stall, a fence and nothing more.

XLIV

And, thus, Tatiana everyday
Goes visit all her kindred’s dinners
To all her folks to demonstrate
Her absent-minded passiveness.
The relatives from far away
Are always welcomed with much care
By exclamations, bread and salt...
“You’ve grown up, Tanya! But, how odd!
I hold you on my hands, sometimes!
I used to feed you with the cakes!
I pulled your ears for childish pranks!
I retain how you were baptized!”
In chorus all the grannies say...
“How fast the years do fly away!”

XLV

But you don’t see in them the changes,
They are old fashioned specimens.
Thus, aunty Helen’s hat with laces
Is just the same for many years.
Lukeria L’vovna whitens face,
Lyubov Petrovna compliments,
Ivan Petrovich - greedy man,
Semen Petrovich - fool, as well,
And Pelageya Pantelevna
Has same boyfriend Monsieur Lepage,
And the same spitz and the same spouse,
The latter is the same club’s member,
He’s same way meek and deaf same way,
As always eats and drinks all day.

XLVI

Their daughters hug Tatiana fondly.
The Moscow youthful Graces, first,
Look at her silently and coldly,
Examine her from top to toes;
Besides they find that she’s weird,
Mincing, provincial, unclear,
And also skinny and too pale,
Though, still attractive and quite fair.
But then, obedient to the nature,
Make friends with her, invite to date,
Give kisses, touch the arms and prate,
Fluff up the curls and behave gracious,
Confide to her the private things,
The maidens’ secrets and the thinks

XLVII

Of their and other’s amour conquests,
Of hopes and pranks and pleasant dreams.
The naive talks and other nonsense
Pour on like rain and never cease.
Then, they require her confession
That should repay their declaration
And make the friendship sweet and meek.
But Tanya feels like in a sleep.
With no concern she hears their speeches,
Doesn’t understand, what do they chat,
Doesn’t want to share her secrets, yet,
And to expose to them the features
Of her beloved, and that is why
She's keeping silent all the time.

XLVIII

Tatiana tries to analyze
The conversations and the talks;
They in the parlor exercise
Such rambling, banal dialogs.
The atmosphere is languid, pale,
Even the slander is the same.
And in the speeches’ uselessness,
News, gossips, questions and requests
You’ll never hear for a full day
A clear, sensible idea,
Which touches languid heart for real,
Neither by chance, nor other way.
Even a nonsense, which is droll,
You’ll never meet in this void world.

XLIX

The gilded youth by a thick crowd
Casts at Tatiana a stiff gaze,
Talk over her between each other
Showing the ill-disposed disgrace.
Someone, who looks like wistful jester,
When viewing her goes into raptures,
And standing leaning on a door
An elegy prepares to her.
One day, when visiting his aunty,
Vyazemsky at her took a seat,
To entertain her did succeed.
And an old man, who saw him chatting,
Enquired gently, who is that,
And the old fashioned wig did set.

L

But there, where stormy Melpomen
Utters the long-drawn-out wails
(To please the women and the men
By waving tawdry gown she fails),
Where Thalia has lightly dozed,
Since does not hear the fans’ applauds,
And Terpsichore is only one,
Who marvels viewers, mostly young
(It also happened in past years,
When used to live and I, and you),
Nobody noticed her or viewed.
Neither lorgnettes of jealous dames,
Nor tubes of fancy connoisseurs
Did turn to her from armchair rows.

LI

They bring her to a public meeting.
It's cram, excitement and ardor,
The music play, the candles blinking,
The dancing couples flood the floor.
The beauties in light gowns attired,
The people’s crowd never tired,
A circle of the future brides -
All causes rapture and surprise.
It is a place where beaus show fashions,
Present their insolence and vests,
And absent-minded lorgnettes.
Hussars come here to spend vacations,
They rush to sparkle and to mate,
To thunder, capture and escape.

LII

There’re many bright stars in the night,
In Moscow many beauties shine.
But there’s no star, which is more bright
Than Moon prevailing in the sky.
But she, whom my poetic lyre
Doesn’t dare to trouble by a rhyme,
Among the ladies and the girls
Like Moon her beauty does expose.
What haven’s pride she’s demonstrating,
When touches by her feet the earth!
What bliss her breast is breathing off!
Her look is languishing and blessing!
But that’s enough, enough, I say...
You’ve paid for recklessness quite fair.

LIII

Noise, laughter, bustle, bows and greetings,
Gallop, mazurka, waltz, they dance.
Tatiana is unnoticed sitting
At a side column with two aunts.
She looks at all this fancy chick,
The high society makes her sick,
She’s suffocating... in her dreams
She streams back home to woods and fields,
The countryside and its poor dwellers,
And solitude of the nice nook,
Where flows her native lovely brook,
Back to the blossoms, novels’ heroes,
Dusk of the alleys of old limes,
Where he appeared to her sometimes.

LIV

Her thoughts are roaming far away,
She has forgotten noisy ball,
But a grand general right there
Is watching her across the hall.
The aunties noticed this straight glance
And pushed Tatiana both at once,
And whispered both to her at that...
- Look quickly, darling, to the left. -
“Left? Where is it? What’s going on?”
- It does not matter, turn your head...
Just over there, where people stand,
There are two men in uniform...
He stepped aside... and now sideways...
“This stout general, you say?”

LV

I offer my congratulation
And leave Tatiana for a while,
It’s time to change my tale direction
Not to forget of whom I rhyme...
And by the way, two words in an add-on...
I glory here my youthful fellow
And all his oddities, that’s why,
Please, bless the job I do long time,
You, epic Muse I am admiring!
And hand to me a rightful staff,
Not to be lost at a wrong path.
Enough, no bonds and no more tiring!
I’ve honored classicism, and thus,
Though late, prelude is done at last.


Chapter VIII

I

It was in Lycee’s lovely alleys,
Where I serenely bloomed in peace,
When I was fond of Apuleius
By reading Cicero displeased.
In spring, on Orphic mystic meadows,
Where swans were calling in the valleys,
Where in the calm the waters shined
Poetic Muse to me arrived.
Enchanting Muse illuminated
My student’s cell at that nice place,
And elegized the child’s plays,
The youthful sprees initiated,
She glorified my hearth and home
And tender dreams in flaming soul.

II

The world received her with a smile;
The first success encouraged me;
There, old Derzhavin had inspired
And blessed me stepping to the bier.

III

And thus, the tyranny of passions
Replaced to me the law and rules,
And I complied with crowd’s fashions
And drew my lively frisky Muse
To noisy feasts and raving clamors,
And thunderstorms of midnight revels.
To all these reckless crazy feasts
She used to bring her magic gifts,
And to me like Bacchante facing
Empting a cup she song to guests,
Young generation of the past
Was after her like crazy chasing.
It made me proud to amaze
My friends by lassie in those days.

IV

When I forsook their young communion
And ran away, I was pursued.
I’d formed with tender Muse a union
And all the way she wasn’t mute,
But pleased me by the magic tales,
On the Caucasian winding trails
Like Lenora with me did speed,
When moon was following the steed!
How often on Taurida’s shores
She led me in the dusk of night
To watch the murmur of seaside,
Nereids’ unceasing tender songs,
Eternal deep chorus of waves,
The anthem, which the Lord does praise.

V

She had forgotten bliss and brilliance
Of feasts in capital’s remote,
In meek Moldova’s wilds and forests
In the beyond of civil world
She used to visit nomads’ dwellings,
Tabernacles of the barbarians,
And had forgotten the Gods’ speech,
And to a scanty language switched
To sing the steppe that she was praising.
But suddenly all that has changed
And in my garden now she stands,
A country maiden I am gazing.
With grief and sorrow in her eyes
She hands a book in French and sighs.

VI

Now, I feel mounting excitement,
Since for the first time introduce
My beloved Muse to high society,
And thus, feel jealous and confused.
She’s sliding through a shining crowd
Of diplomats, who look so proud,
Aristocrats and army dandies
And all these fancy looking ladies.
And she admires all this chaos,
Flashing of speeches, ladies’ dress,
Welcoming of the coming guests
By a young lady of the house,
Like at a picture standing men,
Who for the ladies make a frame.

VII

She’s pleased by oligarchic manners
And proud coldness in the air,
And how the high society gathers -
A mixture of the ranks and years.
But who is there in elite crowd,
Stands mute and vague in live surround,
He looks like stranger at this place,
And watches people with stern face
Respecting them as boring medley?
What can you read on his pale face?
What is he doing at this place?
And who is he? Is it Onegin?
Oh! Can it happen? Yes, may be!
- How long ago he was dropped here?

VIII

IIs he the same or pacified?
Or is still posing as oddball?
What is he after self-exile?
And what so far he will prefer?
What will he demonstrate today,
And whom this time he’ll try to feign?
Harold, or Quaker, or Melmoth,
Cosmopolite or patriot?
Or he is now just decent fellow,
Like you and I is fair and nice?
At least, remember my advice...
The decayed fashion do not follow.
For long he used to fool the world...
- Are you acquainted? - Yes and not.

IX

- But why are you so negative,
When estimating my old friend?
Maybe, you just can not perceive
His merits and don’t understand
That carelessness of ardent natures
For those, who are worthless and selfish,
Looks like offense, or fun, or lies,
And loving scope the mind ties,
And very often idle speeches
We’re glad to take as real deeds,
That foolishness a harm conceives,
That big wigs value absurd features,
Just mediocrity we praise,
Don’t blame and do not find strange!

X

Blessed is the one, who’s young from youth,
Blessed is the one, who’s on time matured,
Who cold of being endured smooth
And did not rush against the nature.
Who never trusted to odd fables,
Didn’t keep away from high life’s rabbles,
Who was in twenty fop or bold,
In thirty matched like found gold;
Who being fifty was released
From private and all other debts,
Who all his glory, cash and ranks
Obtained in turn without fierce,
Of whom a hundred years they talk...
N.N. makes pride of all his folk.

XI

It’s sad to think that just for nothing
You've spent the treasure of young days,
That you’ve betrayed the youth and something
You’ll never do, it’s passed away;
That all the best expected deeds
Came true just only in your dreams,
You’ll never have a chance again;
The reveries like leaves decay.
It is unbearable to find
Just chain of meals in front of you,
Look at the life as at a queue
And following a solemn crowd
To realize that you do not
Share public’s passions and its thoughts.

XII

It is unbearable, I say,
Be reputed as feigned eccentric
Among the people who are fair,
To pass for sorrowful odd fellow
Or even Demon, whom I fame.
I’ll show Onegin now again.
Has killed his fellow at a duel,
Has lived till twenty six years old
Without purpose, with no job,
For nothing killing time as usual,
Without wife, by spleen entailed
To occupy himself he’d failed.

XIII

And he was seized by a displeasure,
By wish to switch to other sites
(Not for too many it makes pleasure
To overcome the ills and ties).
Thus, he had left his country dwelling,
The fields and woods secluded staying,
The places, where the bloody shade
Disturbed him giving no escape.
And started like a pilgrim roaming
Complied with feelings, purposeless,
But shortly changing of a place
Like all the other things turned boring;
He returned back and after all
Like Chatsky got from ship to ball.

XIV

But something happened in the chaos,
A whisper spread in the state hall...
It's to the lady of the house
A dame is coming, not alone,
A general makes her escort.
She’s not loquacious and not cold,
Her look is always calm and fair,
Success is not her major gain,
Without all that bagatelle,
Doesn’t try to imitate somebody,
Looks like a quiet, easy body,
The Frenchmen probably would say
Du comme il faut... (Shishkov, no odds,
I can’t select the Russian words).

XV

The ladies started to move forward,
The old ones could not hold the smiles,
The gentlemen bowed a bit lower
And tried to catch her tender eyes;
The damsels tried to look more shy,
When they were strolling nearby,
A general, who came with her,
Showed pride and drew up best of all.
No one would say that she is splendid,
But neither you, nor friends of yours,
When viewing her from top to toes,
Could ever say, when being candid,
That she, how we from London learn,
Is vulgar (Can’t find other term...

XVI

I love so much this English word,
But do not know how to translate,
It is quite new in Russian world
And scarcely will deserve high rate.
In epigram it would work, maybe ...)
But I return to my fair lady.
Looking light-hearted, nice and sweet
She at the table took a sit
With Nina Vronsky, who, you see,
Is Neva’s famous Cleopatra,
Who radiates the bliss, etcet(e)ra,
But at same time, you should agree,
Despite of all her marble splendor
Could not eclipse her modest neighbor.

XVII

“It cannot be, - reflects Onegin, -
Can she be here? Oh, yes ... But, no...
From thickets and the backwoods’ cabins..."
And he directs lorgnette to her.
But cannot get a clear answer,
And in his mind he is transferred
To what had happened far ago.
“My prince, please tell me, do you know,
Who is it, in a crimson hat,
With Spain Ambassador now talking?”
The prince replied with Eugene walking...
- You have not been presented, yet?
For long you’ve slighted the high life! -
“But who is she?” - She is my wife. -

XVIII

“So, you are married! I can see!
And how for long?” - Soon for two years. -
“And who is she?” She’s Larins, nee. -
“Tatiana!” - Do you know her? - “Yes,
She was my neighbor”. - Then, let’s go. -
Prince brings Onegin close to her,
And then presents his friend and kin.
Tatiana casts a glance at him...
Yes, she was puzzled by the meeting,
No doubt, it disturbed her soul,
But no confusion she did show
Though wasn’t prepared to Eugene’s greeting...
She had retained her look and tone,
Her bow was calm and voice was low.

XIX

She did not show just any fever,
Her face didn’t neither blush nor pale...
She did not move a muscle, even
Did not compress her lips, I swear!
Onegin searched in great impatience
For past naive Tatiana’s traces,
But just no features have retained.
He tried to talk, but could not say
Even few words. Though, she inquired,
How long he’s here and where’s he from,
Isn’t he from backwoods so well known?
And after that her look turned tired,
And with her husband she slipped off...
Onegin stayed upset and shocked.

XX

Is she that one Tatiana, really,
From god forsaken far remote
(Of whom I told in the beginning),
Who to him sometimes wrote a note;
By good intention being driven,
He gave her lesson in the garden,
The one, whose letter he still keeps,
Where every line with ardor speaks,
Who was so frank, whose soul was burning;
Is she that girl ... or it’s a dream?
This girl, who didn’t stir any thrill,
Whose feeling he was just ignoring;
And isn't this lady he just saw
A bashful girl he used to know?

XXI

He's leaving the cramped public meeting
And drives back home to go to bed;
There, in a late sleep he is seeing
A dream now pleasing and now sad.
When waking up, he gets a letter
From prince NN. What is the matter?
Invites to visit him tonight.
My God! I’ll see her, yes, all right!
He writes response polite and pleasing.
What’s going on? Is it a dream!
And something stirred inside of him,
His lazy soul is moved by feeling...
What is it, vanity or else?
It’s youthful trouble - love (I guess)!

XXII

Again Onegin shows impatience
And counts hours again.
But it chimes ten and to the entrance
He gets as soon as only can.
He comes inside with trepidation;
Princess is single in the mansion.
They sit together for a while,
But the right words he cannot find.
Onegin looks inept and gloomy,
He hardly gives the right response;
His head is full of stubborn thoughts;
His gaze is stubborn, he has truly
Forgotten words; and at same time
Tatiana looks quite free and fine.

XXIII

The husband enters terminating
This so upsetting private stay,
Starts with Onegin recollecting
The former years’ mischief and play.
They start to laugh. The guests arrived.
With a coarse salt of public spite
They animated conversation
And stirred the common agitation.
In front of hostess light talks flitting
Was interrupted time to time
By wise discussions of past time
With no coarse subjects or nitpicking.
And fluid vividness of these
Didn’t scare at all nobodies’ ears.

XXIV

Here was metropolis’s cream,
The elite and the fashion models,
Those, who get overall esteem,
And always necessary clowns;
Here were old ladies in a drowse,
In caps and roses, ill-disposed;
The damsels standing at the wall,
The persons, who don’t smile at all;
Here was an envoy, who debated
Political and state affairs;
A fragrant old man with gray hair,
Whose jokes were so much outdated
That despite all his witty wise
He looked ridiculous sometimes.

XXV

Here was an angry gentleman,
Who was to epigrams so greedy
That scoffed at sisters’ monogram,
At oversweeten tea and sweetie,
At flatness of the femme du monde,
At high society men’s wrong tone,
At lies of magazines, at war,
At obscure novel and so on.

XXVI

Here was Prolasov, who had gotten
His fame by meanness of his soul,
Thus, not one pencil he had broken
When staining albums overall;
Here a dictator of the balls
Stood like a picture at the doors,
Like ruddy cherub at Palm week
He did not move, was mute and pink;
Here was a traveler - by chance
Appeared at home starched brazen guy,
In all the guests evoking smile
By mannered posture he advanced;
The mocking glances with no word
Displayed a verdict he was worth.

XXVII

But my Onegin spent the evening
Watching Tatiana, no one else,
Yet, not the girl stirred by the feeling,
Enamored, simple and artless,
But a princess, aloof, cold-blooded,
Goddess inscrutable for mind,
Who at the Neva’s banks does reign.
Oh, people, you are all the same,
Behave like your foremother Eva...
What you do have - does not attract,
The serpent does seduce and tempt,
Calls to the tree of good and evil...
Forbidden fruit you want to eat,
If not, then, Eden you don’t need.

XXVIII

How unexpected were these changes!
How well Tatiana played the role
Of an unblemished noble lady,
How well complied with the great world!
And could you find in this lady,
Who looked so stately and so fairy,
The features of a tender girl?
And he sometimes disturbed her soul?
Morpheus did not, yet, arrived,
Her languish look by Moon was seized,
She flied to him in virgin’s dreams,
Bewitched by magic dark of night.
She wished her life with him to share,
To take submissively his way!

XXIX

The love can conquer any ages,
But for the virgin youthful hearts
It’s bursts are worth of highest praises,
Remind me the vernal floods...
The fields attain required freshness,
Revive and ripen in rain’s passions;
The life is seeking to produce,
Both, gorgeous blossoms and sweet fruits.
But in the late and fruitless years,
When your life stream is turning back,
The passion’s trace looks dead and sad.
The autumn storm destroys and rends,
By ugly bogs replaces meadows;
Instead of forests we get shadows.

XXX

Alas, no doubt, my Onegin
Like a teenager fell in love;
In melancholy always staying
He can not think of other stuff.
Despite the common sense approach,
He drives to her vitreous porch,
And does it almost every day,
And chases after her like shade;
He feels so happy when he’s slipping
A fluffy boa on her neck,
Or manages her way to track,
While she is graciously proceeding
Through mannered crowd of beau monde,
Or to her gestures can respond.

XXXI

She does not notice all his troubles,
However hard he tries, in vain.
She still receives him at her house,
May at the routs few words say.
Sometimes she greets him by a bow,
Then, does not notice him at all...
There is no coquetry in that -
The high life does not like him, yet.
Onegin is morbidly paling -
She does not see, or does not care,
He’s starting pining - still no way.
It is consumption, people saying.
They send Onegin to hakeem,
And this prescribes the spa to him.

XXXII

He does not go there and is ready
Before right term to follow dad.
Tatiana still is calm and steady
(What can you do, they’re all like that).
But he is stubborn, does not stop
To follow her and cherishes hope;
And bolder than a healthy man
The sick man writes a letter, then,
A passionate and reckless letter.
Though he considered it in vain
To write the letters and complain,
But heart ache is an acid matter,
It made him resolute and bold,
Here is his letter, word-to-word.

Onegin’s letter to Tatiana

I can foresee, you’ll be offended
By my sad mystery explain.
Your eyes will radiate disdain,
Despise to me will be extended!
What do I want? What is the reason
To show to you my naked soul?
And what a vicious derision,
Maybe, will stir my reckless call!

I happened meet you years ago,
A spark of tenderness you showed,
But to believe I did not dare,
And did not follow the sweet habit,
Just of my freedom, so repellent,
At that time I preferred to care.

One more thing separated us:
Poor Lensky tragically perished.
And all what pleased my heart at once
So accidentally was ravished.
Thus, alien to the world and sad,
I thought that liberty and quiet
Can replace happiness, but find
A severe punishment for that!

I’d love to watch you every moment,
To follow you at every turn.
Smile of your lips, of the eyes movement
That’s what I love to see and learn.
To listen to you, comprehend
By loving soul all your perfection,
In front of you in thrill to stand,
To pale and still in great affection!

I am deprived of that, and thus,
Drag after you on chance relying.
I value hours, - alas,
In useless boring they are dying.
The fate has counted all these,
And they are painful besides this.
I know that my age is determined,
But to continue my life way,
I must be sure in the morning
That shall see you again by day…

I am afraid that in my praying
Your severe look will find proof
Of a sly person’s undertaking,
Thus, I foresee irate reproof.
If you could know, what a disaster
To suffer thirst of love in vain,
To burn, then, terminate to foster
The admiration sense by brain,
To wish to nestle at your knees
And at your feet burst out sobbing,
Pour out secrets, prays, appeals,
All what my soul to fit affording.
And at same time for all that craving
To simulate cold speech and gaze,
Pronounce common banal phrase
While cheerful look at you remaining!

But let it be, what can I do,
I can’t withstand it anymore
And play this miserable role,
My fortune I entrust to you.

XXXIII

There’s no reply. He writes next letter,
But to the second, to the third
No answer, yet. Just some days later
He’s at a gathering, and what?
She is approaching looking stern
And does not see him, not at all!
Her eyes now radiate utmost
Siberian severe frost!
His soul is full of indignation!
His lips compressed, he cannot speak,
She looks so calm, she is not sick!
He cannot find explanation...
Where are the traces of the tears?
There’s none, just remains of the fierce...

XXXIV

Besides, perhaps, of secret fear.
The world and husband can suspect
The pranks, unfaithfulness reveal...
All what Onegin knew of that...
There is no hope! Onegin leaves
By his foolhardiness displeased.
And being by regret absorbed
He, as before, disclaims the world.
And in his study’s taciturn
He is remembering that time,
When he remained in self exile,
Avoided public life’s uproar,
And by severe khandra was chased,
It trapped him, in dark corner placed.

XXXV

He started reading in succession
The books by Gibbon and Russo,
Manzoni’s and Chamfort’s reflections,
Madame de Stael, La Biche, Tissot,
The skeptical essays by Belle,
Philosophy by Fontenelle,
Some native books he also read
Rejecting nothing; besides that,
The almanacs and magazines,
Where sermons they reiterate,
Where against me today they prate,
Though, sometimes used to praise and please.
What can I tell about them...
E sempre bene, gentlemen.

XXXVI

And what? His eyes continued reading,
But mind sought for something more;
Dreams, wishes, grieves of human being
Were deeply harassing his soul.
And between all the printed lines
He read by the spiritual eyes
The other lines, and just by these
He used to be completely seized.
These were the mysteries and legends
Of obscure cordial old times,
Beyond his comprehension signs,
The prophecies you can’t imagine,
Fears, rumors, lively fairy tales
Or maiden’s letters worth of praise.

XXXVII

And little by little he got seized
By lulling of the thoughts and sense.
And his Imagination dreams
And shuffles cards like faro plays.
Sometimes a youthful guy he’s seeing,
On melting snow he’s quietly dreaming
Like at a peaceful nighttime stay.
- That’s that. He’s killed. - Someone does say.
Then, he sees slanderers, mean cowards,
For long forgotten evil foes,
The former friends, who despise cause,
A swarm of young unfaithful lovers,
Then, country home, chilled glassy pane,
And she is sitting... She again!

XXXVIII

He was so much upset by all that
That started to behave like mad,
Or even turned to be a poet.
He’d made me by that pretty glad!
It’s quite correct... at that right time
He was quite close the words to rhyme.
My muddle-headed pupil, thus,
The Russian rhymes began to grasp.
Yes, he resembled quite a poet,
When in a corner sat alone.
In fireplace the flame was on,
And he was Benedetta purring
Or Idol mio, and same time
Dropped shoe or book into the fire.

XXXIX

The days ran fast; the winter air
Warmed up, the bitter cold extinguished.
To be a poet he didn’t dare,
Did not get mad, the life didn’t finish.
The spring gives life to him and, thus,
He leaves his dwelling place at last,
Where he spent time like ground hog,
With double windows always locked
By fireside spleen exercising.
The sky is blue, the bright sun shines,
In sleigh by Neva’s bank he drives
And watches how the snow is piling,
The ice turns blue, the people hives.
Where do you think my hero rides?

XL

Can you divine, where’s Eugene speeding?
Yes, you are perfect, he has got
To Tanya’s home, where she is living.
Here is my hero, sad and odd.
He walks in looking like dead pale,
Meets nobody in a hallway,
Enters a parlor, no one, yet,
Proceeds ahead and what is that?
What can stir up such a strong feeling?
Princess that sits in front of him,
Alone, not decorated, dim.
A letter in her hands, she’s reading,
The tears are streaming, looking meek
She’s leaning against hand by cheek.

XLI

Oh, is there somewhere such a being
Who could not see her pain at that!
Who could not recognize the feeling
Of former Tanya, shy and sad!
Embraced by mad regret and grief
Onegin dropped at Tanya’s feet.
She startled slightly, staying mute
At Eugene turned her distant look
With no astonishment or anger...
And she perceived his obscure gaze
And by his view was not amazed.
She looks aware. A simple maiden,
Who dreams and feels like in passed days,
Has resurrected nowadays.

XLII

She does not raise him up, besides,
To look at him she cannot end,
Can not the avid lips deprive
Of right to kiss her senseless hand...
What is she dreaming now about?
They stay for long remaining silent,
And finally she gave a sigh...
“Enough, please, listen for a while.
I want to be sincere and honest.
Do you remember this nice place,
Where Fortune put us face to face,
The garden alley, lake and forest?
You gave a lesson, I did learn.
I think today it is my turn.

XLIII

It seems to me, when being younger,
I should be better than am now;
I loved you not by love to brother,
How did you pay me for my love?
What was response? The stern reflection.
You wouldn’t deny, shy girl’s affection
Didn’t make a novelty to you.
Till now, my God, I feel so poor,
The blood runs cold, when I remember
Your cold reprimand and your gaze.
I do not blame you... dreadful days...
It was so noble to surrender...
You were correct with me and fair
And I am grateful for your care.

XLIV

You shouldn’t deny that in the desert,
Away from vanity and fame,
You did not find me be pleasant.
Why are you chasing me today?
Why do you now single me out?
Is it because at high life’s routs
As a princess I now appear,
Nobility and wealth reveal?
My husband by the war is maimed,
And we are by the court caressed,
And now you search for my disgrace,
To be in the whole world defamed,
And by attempting evil fate
You’d gain the tempting high life rate?

XLV

I’m weeping now... But if you haven’t
Forgotten Tanya of passed day,
Then please do know, I swear by Heaven,
From all these things you should refrain.
And if I have a chance to choose,
Your cold response and sense abuse
I should prefer against the passions,
Your letters and the love expressions.
In the old days you showed compassion,
At least respect to my young years.
And what today, what odd affairs,
What trifle brought you to this session!
How can you with your heart and brain
Be a mean slave of sense and fame?

XLVI

You know, Onegin, all this brilliance
And tinsel of the fashion style,
The high society bright experience,
My fancy house and this shine
Are vanity, and I’ll be glad
Replace this trash and masquerade,
These luster, noise and exclamations
By former simple habitation,
By this so meek and nice surround,
Neglected garden, books, all that
Where you and I first time had met,
And by the sad burial ground,
Where now the cross and branches’ shade
Spread over my poor nanny’s grave...

XLVII

We could be happy, yes, could be.
But my fate is resolved already!
You can complain that, probably,
Sometimes I was not too much wary...
My mother implored shedding tears,
Poor Tanya could not withstand these.
All lots to me looked just the same.
And I got married. Thus, I say,
You should not chase me anymore.
I know that you till now retain
Your perfect features and are fair.
I love you, but what is it for?
To other man I am a wife
And will be faithful all my life”.

XLVIII

She’s left. Onegin stays upset,
Like being stricken by a thunder.
And what a passions’ storm at that
His weary soul has now to endure!
But clinking of the spurs we hear,
Tatiana’s husband enters. Here
We’ll say good bye to my tale’s hero,
Right at this minute so much evil
We leave him there. And how for long?
For long, and probably for ever.
It is enough with him to travel
All over. Now we hear a gong,
We’ve moored, and should exclaim Hurrah!
It’s time to finish it, so far!

XLIX

Whoever are you, my verse reader,
A friend or enemy, I do
Want to part with you as a fellow.
Forgive me please. Whatever you
Did search in these nonchalant verses,
The memoirs, recollection sources,
Or a repose of your hard job,
The lively pictures or catchword,
Mistakes in grammar, spelling errors,
God willing, I’ll be very glad,
If reading this book you could get,
For heart, for fun, for journal quarrels
At least a chip of feel and sense.
I beg for mercy and say thanks!

L

Farewell to you, my odd companion,
And you, my Idol, fair and true,
And you so living and continual
My modest work. I’ve learned with you
All that, what causes poet’s envy...
Oblivion in the high life rally,
The sweet discussions with the friends.
So many, many days have passed
Since that time, when Tatiana’s image
And my Onegin in a dream
Appeared to me and brought to thrill,
And I began to plan and cherish
My future novel’s obscure span,
Through magic crystal it to scan.

But you, to whom at friendly meeting
I declaimed my first novel’s rhymes…
These are away, those beyond reaching,
As Sadi used to say sometimes.
Onegin was besides that pictured.
And she, who by my Muse was featured
As an Ideal and high praised…
So much, so many Fate erased!
Blessed is the one, who has left early
The Being revel and full cup
Of wine has not yet bottomed up,
Who hasn’t read to the end Its story,
But quitted suddenly, that’s why
I say to my Onegin bye.

The End
